The Trump Administration Rolls Back the Clean Water Act," \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1eBxEwiqi4&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1eBxEwiqi4&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nPresident Trump’s EPA just restricted the bodies of water that the federal government can regulate to: the territorial seas and traditional navigable waters, Perennial and intermittent tributaries to those waters, Certain lakes, ponds, and impoundments, and Wetlands adjacent to jurisdictional waters. This unfortunately means that the federal government is no longer enforcing laws over many other waters, including groundwater, wetlands that are not adjacent to large bodies of water, some seasonal streams that flow for only a portion of the year,  and “ephemeral” streams that only flow after rainstorms.

Mercury, PCB and other run off from Russian Industry off their Pacific coast, (Is where I guess is what they are calling, Russian Waters, wild caught.)  It's skin on too, which is great for Omega 3 but also can contain the high levels of contamination if present in the water.  Also understanding the life cycle of these salmon is are they born in polluted rivers before migrating into the ocean.  And had radioactivity from Japan entered the waters too.

I need your feedback to keep doing research!,"I'm a sailor so one day I got really pissed off due to all the plastic I seen around, being a watchmaker a decided to start a research about recycling plastics to create a wristwatch. Suddenly with my team in Argentina, after months of work and tests we accomplished this (picture added), the project led me to the Netherlands get investment and now for the first time we're going to start the industrial production applying the system (until now just prototypes). Now we need everyones help to actually measure our impact and ask people to order a watch, otherwise my investors will walk away, so we launched a Kickstarter campaign to get pre-orders. I'm not asking to back us but most important could you please share our project? We're everyday talking about CLIMATE ACTION, and CLIMATE JUSTICE and don't see any attempts to actually create something new instead. I think we just can't let pass this kind of things, because let me tell you something the change won't come from the big companies WE us entrepreneurs and consumers have the power to PERFORM. I know this isn't perfect but well I'm a 23 years old guy helping to save natural reservoirs in my country by retrieving the plastic and recycling it. I know this is just the beginning, one day I'll replicate the system in more countries, I want to fight back creating a fair system, a new one, let's create it together.

As Australia (and Victoria) become more environmentally conscious, veganism has surged, with a portion of our population adhering to a strict plant-based diet.\n\nHowever, to make sustainable and consistent dietary changes, they must be achievable in small, everyday changes that anyone can adopt into their eating habits.\n\nClick this post to learn more about how to eat sustainably: [https://kaushiksridhar.com/2020/03/01/eat-sustainably/](https://kaushiksridhar.com/2020/03/01/eat-sustainably/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/fbicz3/eat_sustainably/

We have the idea that we can develop new technology so that we get away from the climate problems, as well as the other environmental problems. We are aware that we are over-consuming. We may also be eating too much meat and we will have to compromise. We are not climate deniers we know it's a serious problem, but we also think it's all about innovation. There is a demand for green products and solutions, which is why companies, as well as the authorities, are investing more and more money in the development of sustainable projects.

The Republicans are, of course, right out for a host of reasons, and I’m fed up with the Democratic Party.

But I part ways with the GPUSA in the policies they propose (a lot of state action, income taxes and so on) to realize those values.

flk8aq,1584660491,"Plastics, Fossil Fuels, and Fast Fashion are damaging our environment...But there is one super plant that could have the solution.","  \n\n\n“Hemp. Aka the most versatile plant on the planet. Hemp is the only plant that can feed you, clothe you, create a home for you, and provide you with natural beauty products.”Source: MindBodyGreen.org \n\nWe are all becoming much more aware of our impacts on the environment, and there is a lot of talk about how to cut down plastic use, slow down fast fashion, and alternative fuels for cars. Well, i'm here to let you know that there is one plant that could be the answer to all of these problems, and more! \n\nThat plant is hemp. \n\nHemp cultivation is becoming more widespread, and as more hemp is grown, it is becoming a highly regarded resource to help make the world a more sustainable and eco friendly place.  Hemp is super multifunctional and has proved itself one of the most versatile natural fibres out there. \n\n“Hemp has been cultivated on planet earth for over 10,000 years. It has been an important source of food and fibre with references dating back to ancient China and Mesopotamia. Applications of hemp plants evolved from simple rope and coarse woven fabric to paper and sail cloth.” Source : HempTrade.ca \n\nDid you know? As a farmer in parts of the USA in the 1600s, it was actually mandatory to grow Hemp on a percentage of your land. Each farmer had to dedicate land specifically to Hemp because it was so widely used. This sadly changed when the government ruled it an illegal plant due to its association with the cannabis plant. \n\nHere's a list of current and up and coming uses for the super plant: \n\nClothes - Yup. Brands such as Hempton Apparel are now bringing out hemp clothing, it is perfect for clothes because is is durable, resistant to odour, UV protective, breathable, comfy, and moisture wicking. \n\nHemp oil - Hemp oil has many uses and benefits, people swear by it. In fact, it has started to become so popular in Australia, there have been cases of it selling out and being hard to get hold of. Hemp oil contains Omega 3 and Omega 6 which are said to help inflammation, so many people with arthritis are using it.  \n\nHemp moisturiser and skin care - Hemp is used in face moisturisers, and even to help with the aging process, and help treat acne. \n\nNutrition - Hemp seeds are becoming routine in the diets of many health conscious people. Why? It is great protein (popular in vegans and vegetarians), it also contains Omega 3 and 6 fatty oils, Omega 9, Minerals (Calcium, Iron, Magnesium), and Vitamins.\n\nFood - Not only can you get hemp seeds, and hearts, but people are starting to experiment with hemp in food more, such as Hemp burgers! \n\nHemp milk - Yup. There’s a new contender for non dairy milk. Hemp milk is pretty darn good for you too. It is lactose, soy, and gluten free and high in fatty acids and proteins. It is very nutritious, and people have even started making it themselves at home. \n\nHempcrete - Hemp has been used as a replacement for concrete for many years as I found out last year, and is now becoming increasingly in demand. \n\nI’m certainly no expert in hempcrete, concrete or any other elements of construction, so here's a bit on hempcrete from a far more knowledgeable source:\n\n“It has great energy efficiency. It maintains a steady temperature. It doesn't shrink, so there are no crack lines. It is a breathable material.”  Source: Houseplanninghelp.com \n\nRope - One of the oldest uses for hemp, possibly the original.  Hemp has been used in rope in all kinds of trades, but is famous for its uses in shipping. \n\n“In 1997, a hemp rope dating back to 26900 BC was found in Czechoslovakia, making it the oldest known object to be associated with cannabis.” Source: Ancient Origins \n\nSoap - Hemp is known to be gentle on sensitive skin, as well as being moisturising, so it makes the perfect ingredient for natural soap. \n\nFuel - Hemp biofuel is being discussed as a possibility. As we are becoming more conscious and trying to remove the use of fossil fuels, scientists are looking for a way to make an environmentally and sustainable fuel, and hemp is being talked about a lot right now, so watch this space! \n\nSunscreen - With it’s natural UV protection properties, and it's moisturising feeling, it has started to be used in making sunscreen, and with much less harmful ingredients, compared with some other options on the market. \n\nBeer - Heck yes. Hemp beer is on the market. Gluten free, vegan friendly beer with hemp in it. Because, why not?! \n\nPet food - Because we can’t keep this hemp goodness all to ourselves - It’s great for our pets too! There is currently cat and dog food enriched with hemp oil, and some brands have been recommended by vets. \n\nPet bedding - A safe, natural option for pet bedding, which offers comfort as well as antimicrobial properties. \n\nPaper - Hemp paper has been around for years - in fact it can be traced back to around 200 BC in China. \n\nInteresting Fact:\n\nThe first draft of the declaration of independence was written on hemp paper.\n\nProtein powder -  I must admit, nutrition definitely isn't one of my expertise so I looked over a few websites to learn a bit more about this. Turns out hemp protein powder is meant to be pretty good. \n\n“Hemp protein powder is a high-quality plant-based protein that contains 20 amino acids — the building blocks of protein. Protein is crucial for developing, growing and maintaining muscles, tissues and vital organs. It also helps boost metabolism and increases fat-burning.” \n\nYoursuper.com \n\nNappies/diapers - Hemp nappies for babies are becoming a big thing. The main reasons hemp is so good for diapers are; It is environmentally friendly (we already know this), it’s baby friendly - the fabric is tested and certified to be safe to use on young babies and children, it’s durable, it’s soft, it’s stretchy, and it’s absorbent. \n\nTo clean soil - I talked about this in a post recently, but it's a valid one for this list, and I love talking about it, because I just think it’s so wonderful. Hemp produces high quantities of biomass, which returns to the soil and decomposes, giving nutrients back into the soil.  Not only that but it also is also able to absorb heavy metals and pollutants (Phytovolatilization). \n\nAn example of this is:\n\nHemp was used to help clean up after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in  Ukraine in 1986, due to its ability to absorb radioactive toxins from the ground.\n\nShoes - This is quite a new thing as far as i can tell, but i’ve seen a couple of brands of sneakers coming out with hemp trainers, as a vegan, and sustainable option. \n\nPlastic - This is beginning to be talked about. The idea of plastic being replaced with ‘bioplastics’, including hemp as one of the runners. \n\nCars - Believe it or not, this is actually a piece of history, which may well make a comeback. Henry Ford made a prototype hemp car back in 1941, which was also designed to run on hemp fuel. If you read up, it seems that it may also become a thing of the future... I think Mr Ford was definitely well ahead of his time there, and onto something. Time will tell. \n\nI really believe this is just the beginning for hemp, it’s a fibre that has a highly growing market, and now you know why. You’ll be hearing about hemp a lot more in future.  Hopefully it really can help to turn this environmental crisis around, because its negative impacts are generally much less than current material we are overusing. \n\nPretty impressive hey? If you know of any other uses for this magnificent plant, please comment below, I'd love to hear of any others you may have. Let me know what you think. \n\nI have just made my own brand of hemp shirts, which I am currently crowdfunding to help get off the ground.  They are available now on Kickstarter, check out the link here to snap one up at our Kickstarter prices. \n\n[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hempton/hempton-super-plant-sustainable-t-shirt-endure-adventure](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hempton/hempton-super-plant-sustainable-t-shirt-endure-adventure)\n\nThanks for reading! \n\nHannah \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A beautiful plant - Hemp ](https://preview.redd.it/73lafq53rpn41.jpg?width=4912&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06d1d5d7368f1e2955c8555b2e6644c62ab3fb8e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Hemp field after harvest ](https://preview.redd.it/8v5zral4rpn41.jpg?width=2896&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f07462788dfa4c77c9137f7c44cb29d01466f18f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Hemp growing](https://preview.redd.it/fawzpdb6rpn41.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de16ad022e11b3dc74b7a990dae43d23fd11e7bf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Hemp shirts ](https://preview.redd.it/ndjnohh8rpn41.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca0f21451fb357288a32e92cc52040dc087cd339)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Could hemp cars and fuel become the new norm?](https://preview.redd.it/f6ltfjvdrpn41.jpg?width=8256&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cd994ff8f48178438c6bf48e2da2f52ce87cf50)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Hemp is grown organically ](https://preview.redd.it/bl4aojvjrpn41.jpg?width=3456&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7016e38dbaf0fe5d8f9a7a0bad4cba797e77f9f0)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/flk8aq/plastics_fossil_fuels_and_fast_fashion_are/

Before this crash we were is a situation where Biden would help the climate. In a world where it's 2021 Biden is the POTUS and the economy is that of 2019. Biden would be willing to moderately help the climate. \n\nHowever, considering the economy we will have in 2021. Biden will be willing to spend little to nothing to fight global warming.\n\nAm I wrong? Am I dumb, mislead or confused? If so please teach me how that's so. I'm very willing to listen. But, as far as I can tell Biden was already a moderate (at best) on every issue. And he is the type of guy to put the economy over the climate. Is he not that? Am I wrong about him? At best he might cut important government safety nets (like social security) to fund fighting global warming.\n\nPresident Biden could easily end up crushing what little popularity the dem party has. Then we could easily get 8 years of a republican president, after 4 years of Biden. Because Biden will probably not know how to manage the mess Trump leaves him. He very might cut popular government programs for reasons I would say are bad. So I could easily imagine a massive number regretting voting for him over Trump. Because of the mess Trump leaves  him. And him failing to manage it well. That's how it seems to me anyway.

After this simple data collection, the core team will analyse and identify the largest environmental problem in their community.

By participating in this survey with a duration of around 5 minutes you contribute to the knowledge about ""green reverse logistics"". Reverse logistics is the process of retrieving goods from their final destination in order to add extra value or to properly remove or destroy the goods. Green reverse logistics includes all reverse logistics practices that contribute to an improved environment such as recycling, remanufacturing and reuse. These practices are not only in line with the growing demand for a better environment but are also proving to be profitable for the companies themselves. Therefore, receiving this benchmark study can be interesting for your company. Participating can be done by clicking on the link below. Please note that the language can be changed into English at the top right corner if this is not done automatically. After having finished the survey, the participant can leave his or her email address to which the benchmark study will be send as soon as the research is finished.\n\n[https://maastrichtuniversity.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_bmH2hzoDtAOtEjP](https://maastrichtuniversity.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bmH2hzoDtAOtEjP)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/gfsbfs/looking_for_manufacturing_sme_employees_to/

But since my wife and I are both working from home these days our water bill has risen. Not substantially, but enough to notice. Water bills are usually rather inexpensive so I'm not as much worried about the increase in money, just the increase in water consumption. Which we probably were using it before but someone else was fronting the bill so it never occurred to me. I know the increase is from toilet flushes. We both drink a lot of water throughout the day which results in lots of trips to the bathroom. \n\nI havent done this, but I recall in the past reading something about adding things to your tank to basically take up additional space in the tank so there's less room for water but it still will rise to the normal level, such as a brick. Is something like this a good idea or is that just asking for problems to creep in? \n\nI've tried only flushing every few times I go, but wife is not as much on board with that method so I'm searching for an alternative just to reduce the amount of water used. Who knows maybe it's not worth it in the long run, but figured it was worth asking.\n\nThanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/hfpq0v/any_suggestions_on_how_to_save_more_water_per/

My footprint is much higher than anticipated because of the appliances I use in the home,  and want to prepare myself to convert to the least carbon intensive setup as possible. Finances do matter, so these swaps aren't being done in one fell swoop.\n\nMy situation : 2 story home owner (~1500 sq ft) on edge of large US urban city. Roughly 6 kw solar array on roof. Connected to utility grid that's a mix of natural gas turbines and renewable solar/wind source energy. Also have natural gas lines installed in house.  Electrical panel fairly new with 200 amp max load. Getting quotes from electricians to plan ahead. \n\nKitchen:\nFridge\nDishwasher \nGas Range\n\nWater/HVAC: each story has own water heater and hvac unit \nTankless Gas Water heater x 2\nGas Furnace x 2\nAir conditioner \n\nLaundry:\nWasher\nGas Dryer\n\n2 bathrooms equipped with low water usage shower heads, faucets,  and toilets\n\nFirst things first.  I immediately have the ability to wire a car charger for an EV (hoping to buy in 2021) , and oven/range setup. Will sell the gas range to a used appliance store and purchase a new induction stove.\n\nIf you are looking for a new range- induction is the future. Quicker, cleaner, safer, better indoor air quality.\n\nNext in line: replacing the older furnace when it craps out with a dual AC/Heat pump and gas dryer to heat pump dryer.\n\nDown the road: replace gas water heaters with electric. They are relatively new and will likely last. Repair appliances myself when possible or financially reasonable,  replace fridge, dish, washer, etc. with energy efficient models when the time arises. \n\nSorry if all disorganized,  on mobile.

jewzlm,1603222902,Ecopin - a social media platform with an environmental focus launches on kickstarter!,"Ecopin is my concept for a social media platform that incorporates a ""social mapping system"" to encourage social media users to go out and participate in their local community. The social map allows users to create and view ""pins"" on a local map. These pins include everything going on in the community, from farmers markets to protests. The two goals of this mapping system are to make users aware of environmental threats that are hidden in their local community and  strengthen local communities through the creation and increased turnout to local events. That being said, it would not be wise to release an app like this during a pandemic, so for now we are focusing on the development on the app so it can hopefully be finished when things are finally going back to normal (who knows when that will be.)\n\nThe second part of the app is a normal social media platform like any other, but the difference is that Ecopin will care for it's users, and not exploit them. There will be no spying or selling of private information, divisive behavior will be extremely discouraged and there will be a large focus on preventing trolls and fake accounts from getting in. Another difference is that while advertisement will exist, it will only be for local and green businesses, unlike other social platforms that give advertisement to the highest bidder (no greenwashing allowed.)\n\n[Here is the landing page with information on the project](http://ecopin.org/index.html)\n\n[Here is the interactive design prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/d4c3249e-8164-48e8-4274-17fae90cd18e-a2f2/screen/a94a6981-1911-4297-84a5-491dcb08fbfb/?fullscreen)\n\n[and here is the kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1870061924/ecopin?ref=discovery&amp;term=ecopin)\n\nI decided to kickstart the project because I need to gather a motivated team of programmers, designers, environmental experts and team leaders. I gathered a small group of programmers passionate about the environment and interested in the project and we managed to start the prototyping process, but all of them have full time jobs and could only dedicate so much time to the project. If you personally have an interest in helping out or giving advice feel free to message me. \n\nI am open to any and all questions on the project, so feel free to comment away any thoughts that come to mind when reading about it! :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/04du1yv8zau51.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f14f865b9eca9d67b1fc38add7098281e2b55fb6",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/jewzlm/ecopin_a_social_media_platform_with_an/

She is also worried that a career as an artist means contributing towards consumerism and waste.\n\nMy personal opinion is that art and expression is what makes life worth living, and that the world needs artists. I havent done much research into how sustainable the printing industry is, but I would imagine that whatever toll it takes on the planet is worth it in the end if it's for art. \n\nSelling designs on products may be a different story, but again i think if its a reusable/sustainable product or a necessity (ex: clothing) that it might not be such a bad thing.\n\nDo you agree or disagree with this?

They are no magic bullet, but they are part of the toolkit we have for mitigating climate catastrophe. Renewable energy was totally unrealistic 30 years ago, solar sucked, and the wind sucked. It was totally economically and spatially infeasible, but investments and development and innovation have made renewables cheaper in some areas compared to fossil fuels, with even more potential avenues of development being walked down. Comparing carbon capture tech of today to the issues, we will have is kind of like comparing the first artificial hamburger cost to the price of a hamburger today. Yes, the first artificial hamburger was extraordinarily expensive, costing like 100000 dollars or something like that, but it was simply a proof of concept, and the price+efficiency of the artificial meat process has gotten better dramatically in only a few years. Of course, I can't promise even that level of success with carbon capture, only say that it is absolutely a route worth pursuing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/juvhbj/some_of_my_thoughts_on_how_to_improve_the/

The hope is to further increase the sustainability of wind power.,"[Source](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/medvind-for-svenska-tratorn)\n\n&gt;The world's first large-scale production of wooden towers for wind power will soon start in Sweden. The hope is to further increase the sustainability of wind power.\n\n\n&gt;As recently as May last year, Modvion's first wooden tower was erected on Björkö outside Gothenburg. Now the world's leading wind turbine manufacturer becomes Danish Vestas' partner in the company, with the aim of introducing wooden towers in its product line to reduce its climate footprint. This means new factories and more employees at Swedish Modvion, which today has a development factory in Gothenburg.\n\n\n&gt;- In this way, we get more Swedish jobs, more renewable delivery from wind power and also show that it is possible to build really demanding dynamic applications of laminated wood, says Otto Lundman, CEO and co-founder of Modvion.\n\n\n&gt;Individual wind turbines have been built in the world in wood in the past, but this construction is planned to be manufactured on a large scale. The hope is to be able to build hundreds of towers per year in just a few years.\n\n\n&gt;**Plywood of spruce**\n\n\n&gt;The wood used in the production is a kind of plywood of Swedish spruce, a material that is stronger by weight than steel and will be able to provide cheaper production, according to the company. According to their calculations, carbon dioxide emissions are reduced by about 30 percent during the construction of a wind turbine with laminated wood towers, compared with a standard steel structure.\n\n\n&gt;**Has managed peak load**\n\n\n&gt;The tower that was erected on Björkö is part of a test wind turbine operated by the Swedish Wind Power Technology Center at Chalmers University of Technology. Several research projects are already underway on the construction and what it stands for.\n\n\n&gt;- It has gone as expected, in some cases above expectations. The greatest load on the tower is when the wind turbine is stationary and there is a storm outside. So we have already tried the peak loads on the tower and it can handle it without further ado. The next step is to examine how well the material works in the long run.\n\n\n&gt;One strength of the design is that it is built in modules. This makes shipping much easier and also opportunities to transport tower parts with a larger diameter than before. It also creates good conditions for being able to build towers for over 200 meters high wind turbines - perhaps over 300 meters in the long run, according to Modvion's CEO Otto Lundman.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/lmijz0/the_worlds_first_largescale_production_of_wooden/

lxxi9g,1614897795,People laughed at him when he was planting trees in the desert! But later on everyone was amazed.,"Jadav Payeng is known as a Forest Man of India. He has spent 30 years of his life planting trees to save his island, creating a forest and restoring its wildlife.All of this began when he was just a little boy. One day the boy went to the local palmist and he prophesied that Jadav’s life will take the course of Nature.\n\nHis story begins in1979.\n\nAfter a devastating flood, he found MANY DEAD snakes on the shore. They died from the heat, since the bank was absolutely deserted, and there was not a single tree that could give them shade, and no  opportunity to return back to the saving river.He wondered what it would look like if the same  happened to humans — the island was being eroded very quickly.\n\nWhat he saw deeply shocked Jadav, he decided to change the situation and make the river bank habitable.He first planted only 20 bamboo seedlings to see if they could take root. The bamboo took root and turned green, so Jadav continued to plant trees. He decided to live in the newly planted forest, looking after it, and planting more and more new territories around with trees.\n\nYou can also watch a video here [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBFuTwdhuINsF6ZjETXsHRQ?sub\_confirmation=1](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBFuTwdhuINsF6ZjETXsHRQ?sub_confirmation=1)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/lxxi9g/people_laughed_at_him_when_he_was_planting_trees/

The internet uses a lot of energy, and that in turn gives it a hefty carbon footprint. According to a study by the Boston Consulting Group, the internet is responsible for roughly one billion tonnes of greenhouse gases a year, or around two per cent of world emissions. Smartphones, laptops, desktops, electric cars, anything that uses a battery or is mass produced causes a significant carbon footprint. Anything that uses electricity leaves a carbon footprint. Electronics are made in a factory that uses a lot of electricity. They need to be shipped using diesel semi trucks. Once an electronic or a battery is discarded it sits in a landfill. If you are not living the life of an Amish, you are contributing to carbon emissions. I only use the internet to relay this message. To tell everyone we need to give up everything. Cars, computers, cellphones, grocery stores, electricity, etc. Traveling to Lansing will only cause carbon emissions. Unless you ride a bike there, but even a bike needs to be made and shipped. Turn away from electricity, our world depends on it!\n\nThank you for your consideration.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/m1icv4/its_time_for_change/

What is relevant about this figure is that ten years ago they practically did not exist.\n\nBetween January and November 2019, Global Green Bond issuances exceeded $ 200 billion, setting a new record, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI). This body forecasts that by the end of this year it will reach 250,000 million US dollars and also estimates that in 2030 projects related to climate change will require an investment of approximately 90 billion US dollars.\n\nSeveral factors are contributing to the boom in this rising market. One of them is a greater participation of new corporate issuers in Europe, America and Asia. The Green Bond market has been experiencing exponential growth since the latest years.\n\nClick to read the full article: https://gbm.news/companies-eyes-on-green-bonds/",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/m5jrbs/greenbonds_market_on_the_rise/

mmkcih,1617857562,Four ethical and sustainable fabric alternatives to polyester fast fashion,"It's no secret that fashion has a lot to answer for, but we're doing something about it at The Fashion Advocate. [**We don't sell polyester**](https://thefashionadvocate.com/blogs/news/were-committed-to-a-more-sustainable-slow-fashion-future-so-we-no-longer-sell-polyester) fashion and we advocate for sustainable, slow, ethical fashion. We also operate with a [**'10 value system'**](https://thefashionadvocate.com/blogs/ethical-and-sustainable-fashion-online/ethics-sustainability), and all of our brands share a minimum of three of our ten values.\n\nDoing our part to have a positive fashion impact is important to us, so every year we commit to one major sustainability change for the better. Last year, it was ditching polyester fashion. Why? Because 63% of fashion is now made with polyester, a synthetic fabric produced with petrochemicals and non-renewable resources. It's a nasty, environmentally devastating fabric, and it has no place in our wardrobes.\n\nNearly 70 million barrels of oil are used each year to make the world's use of polyester, and oil is a non-renewable resource. Once it's gone, it's gone. Polyester garments also take more than 200 years to break down, but they never decompose; tiny plastic particles exist forever.\n\nSo, what's the solution? Ditch polyester and switch to natural, biodegradable, renewable fabrics in your wardrobe, and choose to shop ethically and sustainably.\n\nThere are plenty of sustainable alternatives to polyester fast fashion. Natural fabrics like cotton, hemp, silk and Tencel are better for the environment, less energy-intensive, biodegradable, and they're a healthier option to wear too. The skin is the largest organ, so everything we put on it, goes in it, including the chemicals found in our clothing - another great reason to boycott polyester.\n\nREAD: [https://thefashionadvocate.com/blogs/news/four-ethical-and-sustainable-fabric-alternatives-to-polyester-fast-fashion](https://thefashionadvocate.com/blogs/news/four-ethical-and-sustainable-fabric-alternatives-to-polyester-fast-fashion)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ilhvwktlrvr61.png?width=1246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab2ca6395f684364e77b7564cfe5ce2614d63bef",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/mmkcih/four_ethical_and_sustainable_fabric_alternatives/

This is aimed to be implemented by creating a more friendly and helpful UI on the smart meter via an app that will help the consumer to closely track their spending on gas, electric and water usage. Furthermore, a potential points-based system may help to encourage users, and this questionnaire will allow me to see the viability of that idea. I am mainly looking for responses from those with Smart Meters at home. \n\n[https://forms.gle/BgWKYsFmZdfeLr199](https://forms.gle/BgWKYsFmZdfeLr199)\n\nNo personal information is collected for this but feel free to contact me for any further information. Thank you so much for the help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/mz9t3e/academic_survey_regarding_smart_meter_usage/

oef96n,1625515755,People laughed at him when he was planting trees in the desert! But later on everyone was amazed,"Jadav Payeng is known as a Forest Man of India. He has spent 30 years of his life planting trees to save his island, creating a forest and restoring its wildlife.All of this began when he was just a little boy. One day the boy went to the local palmist and he prophesied that Jadav’s life will take the course of Nature.\n\nHis story begins in1979.\n\nAfter a devastating flood, he found MANY DEAD snakes on the shore. They died from the heat, since the bank was absolutely deserted, and there was not a single tree that could give them shade, and no  opportunity to return back to the saving river.He wondered what it would look like if the same  happened to humans — the island was being eroded very quickly.\n\nWhat he saw deeply shocked Jadav, he decided to change the situation and make the river bank habitable.He first planted only 20 bamboo seedlings to see if they could take root. The bamboo took root and turned green, so Jadav continued to plant trees. He decided to live in the newly planted forest, looking after it, and planting more and more new territories around with trees.\n\nYou can also watch a video here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xKR7Nk7rbg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xKR7Nk7rbg)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/oef96n/people_laughed_at_him_when_he_was_planting_trees/

opfiag,1626965919,"If recycling is a scam, then what should I do?!","*Before we begin, I should make clear that I'm not US-based. Sorry for the eventual mistakes, hope I can communicate well regardless.*  \n**\*TL;DR AT THE END.**\n\nSo... first things first. since earlier this year, I have been consuming more and more information about climate change, sustainability, these important kind of things - and it has led me to be more environment-conscious than ever.   \nThing is: I live in a rather dysfunctional home. I'm 22, and (unfortunately!) still live with my parents, who are... how should I say... *less than fun* to live with. They are very difficult people for a whole lot of reasons, but I'll stick to the earth-damaging bit here. \n\n**MOTHER**  \nMy mother is freaky about cleaning everything all the time to the point that it often becomes unhealthy. Almost like by consequence, she also waste very, VERY much paper and plastic. And a lot more things, to be sincere.  \nWith ""VERY"" I mean: every time she wash her hands she dries it up with paper towel. Every time she drinks water she uses a new disposable plastic cup. Every time she comes home she puts her used clothes in a plastic bag... I could go on and on. She truly is a waste machine.   \nMom is also one of the most arrogant beings that I've ever met — so you know that ""trying to talk her out of it"" is not an option. In fact, I've been there, tried that, was involved in major family ~~havoc~~ conflicts, gave up. Well, using disposable itens is apparently very important for her to feel clean. \n\n**FATHER**  \nI also live with my father, who is (and has always been) a very permissive man. He longs for peace and silence, Mom is very angry, stressed and loud all the time. This situation led him to do everything in his power to keep balance and avoid conflict. Since I was a kid, he's always instructed me to do the same. It means, among **a lot** of other things, that he also does that kind of wasteful things for her. Including things like letting a alcohol-wet paper towel near things, so she knows that the item has already been cleaned up. x)  \nRecently, he became worse. Dad is very prone to any kind of conspiracy, and, in the last couple months, he's been watching videos of a ""professor"" who is — brace yourself! — openly ANTI-SUSTAINABILITY. yes, that man says that ""the lie of sustainability"" will end humanity, that it is a government-communist-globalist project of power/control... well, I don't know details, but I guess you got the point already.  \nSo, problem is: he was already damaging BEFORE he was watching those kind of things, and now he is almost porpusefully wasteful. In fact, he even keeps me from being openly ecofriendly.  \nAlthough he's very different from Mom, he's also very pedant and arrogant in his own way, so trying to talk him out of it is also a no-no. \n\n**WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO**  \nAt this point, you may have guessed that I'm considering moving out as soon as it becomes financially possible for me, which, sadly, can take some time. I need to save around \~$20,000 to safely move out, and it is a LOT of money to reach around here! Oof!  \nWell, truth is that I'll have to stick in here for some more time  — becaus of it, I've been thinking about adopting a harm-reduction-policy. I won't be able to switch to full zero-waste for as long as I'm at my parents, but I'll try to do what I can (without getting involved in any more fights, I hope).  \nSilently using specific cloths for what they love to use paper towels; try to buy things only if strictly necessary and at the highest volume possible, so I can avoid financing more plastic packages; separating the trash so I can send to recycle centers... what, wait. RECYLING IS A SCAM?? WHAT DO I DO, THEN?!  \nI really want to do my part. I'm sure that when I move out I'll be able to be anything that I want, including the ecofriendly independent pretty woman I've wanted to be for so long, but... while I'm here, what the heck should I do (or not do)? I'm looking for little things that I can discreetly incorporate in my routines that should reduce impact — without it being an empty work.  \nThis piece of information about recycling really made me lose perspective on what I should focus on while I'm on this damage-management regimen.   \n\n\n**\*TL;DR:**  I've read that recycling is a scam and I'm not sure on what can I do then. My parents are anti-enviromentalists and keep me from living sustainably. I need input about what can I do to reduce environmental harm when I'm in a situation where I can do almost nothing.   \n\n\n*Disclaimer: please, don't suggest anything in the lines of ""confront them! be courageous!"".*   \n*It may be a weakness of mine, but at the moment I really don't have the mental and physical health to do that anymore. It is always more than stressful and it has never have never been worth it. I'm not in my best self right now, so, I'll try to reduce damage in this part of my life too.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/opfiag/if_recycling_is_a_scam_then_what_should_i_do/

oxkoj3,1628050325,Which is the greener air conditioning practice?,"I watched [this video](https://youtu.be/0f9GpMWdvWI) recently about using your house as thermal energy storage. TL;DW: run your air conditioner at night and super chill your house, then don't run your air conditioner during the day when demand on the grid is high and expensive. If your house is efficient enough, the total energy used shouldn't change much, and you avoid overloading the grid (and your wallet).\n\nI tried this with my house over the past week. I already set the thermostat high during peak time, but my house is less efficient and it still needs to cool for a few hours during that time. With this ""thermal battery"" method, it does reduce how much time is spent cooling during peak hours, but it does add 2-3 hours of use overall per day.\n\nSo my question is: is it greener to use less energy overall, even if during peak; or to use a little more energy overall, but less during peak? I suspect it's the former, but wanted to hear some opinions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/oxkoj3/which_is_the_greener_air_conditioning_practice/

qi2jle,1635474248,why green is the best colour/ from school," \n\nAre you someone who thinks that blue is the best colour? Or red or purple or any others in the rainbow, well if you want the objective answer it’s green. Of course, which colour is the best looking to you might not be objective, but I have Scientific facts and evidence that green is the best colour of them all.\n\nFirst of all, green is the colour of nature and it is everywhere, this suggests that our personal liking of the colour green may be within in us. Green is the most common colour for plants including vital resources like trees which produce oxygen for humans to breathe and wood for us to build with, but trees are not the green plant that is vital to our survival, there are also plants that produce antibiotics which save hundreds of millions of lives. The reason behind green saving so many lives is that before antibiotics existed one cut could be a deaf sentence and think that if you colour green did not exist you or people around would likely die. \n\nAnd now you might be asking (Why are plants green and why must they be that way), well the reason why plants are green is because of a pigment called chlorophyll which can only activate during photosynthesis so then in order for a plant to survive It must be green in some way, of course, their exception with less green on them(mushrooms are not plants they are algae which mean they don’t need sunlight to survive and have another way to get their energy).\n\nIn conclusion, green is the best colour because it is not only, in my opinion, the best-looking colour it is also by far the most important colour for nature and people alike. Plants with a green pigment are used the make antibiotic which when they weren’t invented, one scratch or cut could be a deaf sentence, but with the colour green ten of millions of lives have been saved thanks to the colour green, that is why the colour green is the best.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/qi2jle/why_green_is_the_best_colour_from_school/

qir6iw,1635557628,"KAIN: Green Handbag Line, cruelty free and plant based."," \n\n**October 29, 2021, Brooklyn, New York**\- KAIN, the all new environmentally-friendly luxury handbag line, is live on global crowdfunding platform Kickstarter and raising funds to bring the project to life.\n\nOver the last few decades, there has been increasing awareness and activism about the damage that humans are causing to the environment and the planet. Stores are now filled with ethically made clothing and plant-based meat options are available at restaurants nationwide. One area that has yet to catch up is in the area of true vegan leather. Many “vegan leathers,” as they are often advertised by companies, are actually made of harmful materials such as PVC or Polyurethane; KAIN is taking a revolutionary approach by using a true, plant-based and environmentally friendly material— apple leather a byproduct of the Italian juice industry.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eye2l3grqhw71.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff241c17c96fc363f9e9f3e021af49c77f193799\n\n  \n “There are very few brands that offer a cruelty free handbag with a luxury look, at an affordable price point that aren’t made of hazardous materials. Being bothered by this fact, for both the environment and for our animal friends I wanted to steer the consumers' awareness of this major issue that faces the fashion industry,” says founder and designer Kathleen Walter on the inspiration behind the project. “In a corporate setting I noticed the dismissive reactions in meetings when myself or a colleague would suggest making change for the better whether it be with material or the type of factory. After 10 years of observing this, it felt like it was long overdue that I attempted to make some form of change outside of the workplace.”\n\nTo launch, KAIN is introducing two flagship products— the chain wallet, which can be worn in 4 different ways, and the shoulder bag, which boasts versatility from day to night. All KAIN products are crafted by a committed factory, whose main goals revolve around ethical work practices and the use of recycled materials. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h2o3yp7wqhw71.png?width=1404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f319612da6bf67773f3dba1fad77c906d5e445e1\n\n“We need to normalize environmentally friendly leather alternatives that possess a leather look. Otherwise, brands ranging from fast fashion to mid-price point, will continue to mass produce items that are made of PU and PVC. Progress needs to be made on the availability of ethical leather alternatives,” adds Walter. “With KAIN, my aim is to create an accessible luxury handbag line made entirely of an environmentally friendly and recycled plant-based material.”\n\nKAIN is currently live and available to support on Kickstarter: [www.kickstarter.com/projects/k517/kain](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/k517/kain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pdngy4iyqhw71.png?width=1408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2d6546f4bd6a83086b4cee8edff12820b760d19\n\n**About KAIN**\n\nCreated by designer Kathleen Walter, a graduate of Parsons the New School for Design with a BFA in womenswear. Walters carries over 10 years of experience in the fashion industry designing and developing women's handbags for an array of aesthetics, from brands with a cult following to the commercial and accessible.\n\nFor more information on KAIN please visit: [www.wolf-violet-62l9.squarespace.com](https://www.wolf-violet-62l9.squarespace.com)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w52xcl60rhw71.png?width=866&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2552cdb4ca21a47f64d43b1a5e4b0c6235b3424\n\n\###",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/qir6iw/kain_green_handbag_line_cruelty_free_and_plant/

Ideally, I'd also reach out to environmental orgs and see if they wanted to use them as well. I have a few ideas for the other three, including one with masks, and one themed around the ocean, but I could really use some input from y'all.\n\nThe environment is really important to me, but you guys are more knowledgeable about the intricacies than I am.\n\nThank you so much in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/qtvjin/im_a_photographer_and_i_would_love_your_input_in/

r0ox9n,1637706050,The Greens is the party of the elitist interests.,"The Greens have got to be the most elitist party i have ever known in my life!\n\nAll the Greens, in almost all countries, are the same.\n\nLooking into political graphs, they are consistently speaking for the interests of the urban, the rich, the elite .\n\nThese people man, they do not care about the environment. Greens is NOT a movement of outdoorsmen. Green agenda basically comes down to this: population control. All of their policies aim to reduce human populations, reduce consumption, reduce emissions, and generally reduce human impact on the planet.

r6kvsx,1638381757,The Urban-Green Paradox," We've been hearing about the problem of urban sprawl here in the US for  decades now, especially its affects on the environment and proposed  solutions such as mass transit. This would lessen some of the worst  environmental impacts of our modern urban lives, but in some ways it may  actually make the problem worse. Because as you spread transit networks  out to reach more people and tie outlying areas into the wider network  what you are doing is creating more opportunities for what is called by  some “real estate development”, either in already populated places or in  less densely settled areas.  \nThis either adulterates and debases the  beauty and splendor of our natural landscapes for the benefit of a few,  or increases rents and overcrowds areas that are already intensively  settled. This is what leads to the strange combination of circumstances  that are experienced in southern California, urban sprawl and over  crowding. The simple fact is that there are too many people living in  the coastal areas of southern California. It affects our environment,  our health and in all honestly our sanity.\n\nSome good meaning folks  mention and some delusional politicians ramble on about various proposed  solutions to these twin menaces; again mass transit but also limited  driving days and low cost housing projects. All these except the first  are little more than band aids that will fail to solve the problems of  overcrowding, a rising cost of living and environmental degradation.  While as we have discussed the former actually can in the long term make  them worse. Especially because when mass transit networks are over  expanded and new areas come into settlement the number of people living  in these areas who actually end up using mass transit will likely be  fewer than those newcomers who will continue to drive .\n\nIn the long  run our problem isn't that we don't have enough mass transit, it's that  we have too many people living in too close proximity to each other;  whether in southern California, Houston, Philadelphia or Seattle. Our  cities and even our suburbs are overdeveloped and overcrowded, not just  in California but across the country,\n\nTake for example the town of  Ellicott, Maryland. Here flooding of the local river, partly due to the  soil's inability to absorb massive amounts of rainfall, caused streams  of destruction to roll through the town and across our television  screens; with many people's almost entire lives being washed away. This  was partly due to the mass concretezation of vast tracts of land around  the colonial-era town associated with new home and business  construction. And who could forget the trauma of the Lower 9th Ward of  New Orleans. That disaster would not have occurred if businesses and  people had not been allowed to settle in and “develop” an area of land  so clearly fraught with danger, lying as it does below sea level so  close to the coast.\n\nOf course, then there are the chronic health  risks of living in an overcrowded urban or urbanizing area such as  respiratory issues arising from vehicle exhaust as well as cancers and  birth defects due to industrial pollutants. Not only that but a recent  study has suggested that these same pollutants are affecting educational  performance, lowering both math and language scores for children living  in these over-urbanized areas. A perhaps more immediate threat to the  populations of our largest metropolitan regions can be found in the  potential for the endemic spread of the new super bugs we've heard so  much about from doctors and scientists. These being immune to our most  advanced pharmacology could, once a severe enough breakout were to  occur, easily and quickly spread through our most cramped and medically  under served urban centers, with little time for the authorities to act.\n\nBesides  the physical and health risks associated with crowding such large  groups of humanity together there are also the detrimental social  impacts of a life spent imprisoned within the four walls of modernism.  The sterility of the modern office robs man of his birth right, the joy  of dominion over nature, the pride of marking the soil with the work of  his own two hands. Instead he finds himself frozen in place surrounded  by a cadre of gadgets and machines that he is told will solve all his  problems, but in reality turn him into little more than a feckless  child.\n\nIn this debased world of drudgery mankind becomes isolated and  increasingly apathetic. People fill their time with an endless parade  of distractions promoted by those who wish to see them remain shackled  in oblivion. Among these are the vapid crazes of social radicalism  taught in many of our universities, the cult of modern celebrity and  sexual promiscuity.\n\nChained to such an existence we are consumed by presumption. **Always finding ourselves in competition with our neighbors,**  either to have the latest product or pronounce the latest liberal  talking point in order to “keep up with the Joneses”. All this in search  of some specious urbanite utopia where we are told enjoyment will  abound around every corner and we can be free of many of the negative  consequences of our own actions. Of course this world can never truly  exist and the results are a society depressed, obsessed with consumption  and drowning in debt. Enslaved by both big finance and big tech man  knows not where to turn.\n\nThe solution best suited to combat these  ills will seem quite radical to some. It is the mass re-ruralization of  our society, evacuating large swaths of major cities and resettling  those populations in a dispersed manner across the countryside to  embrace a return to the soil that will help us create a stabler, more  sustainable and healthier society. This would clearly be a long and  drawn out process, likely taking decades to accomplish and requiring the  mobilization of enormous amounts of both material and human resources  the likes of which few have ever seen.\n\nThe United States is a country  endowed with abundant natural resources, amongst which are enormous  amounts of arable land and forests. Cultivated acreage makes up only  about 10% of land in our country, with less then 25% of this being used  to grow food. Whereas urban and suburban areas take up only about 3\*\*%**.  If we take into consideration arable lands left fallow or being used  for other purposes there is clearly enough land to accommodate the  surplus populations of our cities and suburbs. Of course this may entail  the movement of substantial population groups out of certain states and  into others as the quality and quantity of arable land varies in  different regions of the country.**\n\n**These  movements could be best accomplished or at least facilitated through a  combination of tax policy and financial incentives. The first step in  this direction would be to discourage urban living, primarily through  the creation of two parallel tax regimes. With the basic tax structure  for revenue collection from individuals maintained essentially in tact  in rural areas, but at lower levels, while both income and property  taxes would in the main rise over time in all non-rural districts. This  will create the initial push factor that will propel a voluntary move  away from the cities. This general policy will also apply to all  companies and corporations involved in non-agricultural sectors of the  economy, with the exception of those involved in the defense industry.  Whereby many will help to undue the damage they have done to the people,  most especially financial, technology and import oriented businesses.**\n\n**These  levies will be used to fund a program of agrarian incentives used to  promote the re-establishment of the small to mid-sized family farm as  the cornerstone of American society, acting as the concomitant      pull  factor to the above mentioned urban and suburban disincentives. Among  the former will be subsidies for the purchase of tools, livestock and  grain supplies that will accompany the initial resettlement of  populations.**\n\n**To  facilitate the creation of new small to mid-sized family farms a regime  of lower property and sales tax rates will be instituted for small rural  landholders and laborers, accompanied by intermittent multi-year tax  holidays on both revenue sources for family farmers. Any financial  shortfalls incurred by the state in furtherance of these policies will  initially be made up for by an increase in both corporate and property  taxes for industrial scale agribusiness and ranching.**  \n**To  help those farmers who are already established an initial cancellation  of debts will also be instituted for family landholders of longstanding  who posses land below a certain acreage threshold, with distinct   qualifications established for the same purpose in regards to small and  mid-sized livestock breeders. Additionally as protection against future  financial predations all family farms and ranchs will be classed among a  new category of business known as a hereditary enterprise, which will  halt the practice of farm foreclosures by putting in place a moratorium  on attempts to mortgage or sell any piece of a family farm.**\n\n **To ensure  the continuity of these systemic reforms the holders of hereditary  enterprises will be required to pass their property down to their eldest  son upon retirement or after passing on.**  \n**These  reforms would go a long way to addressing the grave imbalances caused  by the so-called industrial revolution. The mechanization of farming  being the main culprit in disrupting traditional ruralism. With the  advent of the cotton gin (1793) and especially mechanical harvesters and  threshers (1834) large landowners were in some ways able to cut their  personnel and force all but the most fierce of their subsistence  neighbors off their land. While the urban tycoons who came to prominence  near the same time exploited the new technologies of mechanized weaving  and other once artisanal trades to destroy the cottage industries of  the villages and small towns. This gave these former merchants ineffable  power over their sometime former partners.**\n\n**This  swelled the ranks of the rural unemployed, forcing them to swarm the  cities in search of wage employment. Due to overcrowding and the** ***increase in food prices that followed these changes***  **people actually had a lower standard of living then before. You might  ask yourself, using the logic of the industrial marketeer** ***'But wouldn't the efficiencies caused by mechanization lead to lower prices?'***  **The answer is no, since once industrial farmers purchased these  foreclosed lands they turned their attention to increasing their own  profits instead of continuing to use these lands for the common good**.  They did this by taking them out of cultivation and converting them to animal pasturage. This raised the prices of staple goods while lowering  the price of many of the luxury foods craved by their urban  counterparts, many of which were still out of reach of the average  person. Of course mechanization also lead to an increase in slavery  across the Americas due to the new ease of growing cotton.\n\nThe plight  of the surviving small farmer did not end when he adapted himself to  the exigencies of the modernizing world. Rather he has been slowly  ground under foot by the radical economic and biological convulsions of  what has been praised in liberal history books and international  business circles as the “green revolution.” A sorry manipulation and  homogenization of nature that serves to enrich industrial agribusiness  at the expense of farmers as well as the general public.\n\nThis began  with the introduction of new chemical fertilizers and pesticides that  were touted as increasing crop yields and helping to solve the world's  food crisis. And to a certain extent these technologies did help society  to move towards these goals. But again the unforeseen consequences   of  these developments have in many ways undermined their scanty benefits.  From the higher rate of miscarriages and birth defects among  agricultural workers to the likely carcinogenic nature of some of the  most famous of these products, some of which can be found in our homes,  the long-term health affects of exposure to these substances can be  highly detrimental.\n\nLater came GMOs (genetically modified crops and  livestock) which were meant to be in many cases resistant to disease,  drought and/or pests. The health affects of these products are unclear  while separately the dominance they and their creators exercise over the  agricultural market has led to a serious lack of diversity and security  in our food supply. Societally we've become so dependent on the  production of such a limited number of varieties of foodstuffs that any  future unanticipated outbreak of disease, for which no provision was  made in the genetic makeup of these products, could wipe out vast  amounts of our grain and animal stocks. Leaving us again vulnerable to  food shortages and famine in the long run.\n\nAnd just as with the  advent of mechanization such technologies have had a ruinous affect on  most small farmers. Again it is the large agribusinesses that are best  able to afford the expense involved in implementing these technologies,  whether it be purchasing seeds engineered to produce greater yields of  grain or cows imbued with hormones to produce larger quantities of milk.  They are then able to flood the market with their produce, lowering  prices for all such goods and destroy any profit that the small farmer  may have hoped to gain.\n\nNot only does the family farmer fall a prey  to his larger competitors due to these technologies, but he is also at  times victimized by the large multinationals who develop them. In a step  seemingly aimed at the eventual total monetization of nature some of  these companies have sought and received intellectual property rights  over the seeds they have engineered. This allows for litigation against  any farmer who has seeds from a GMO crop on a neighbor's property blown  onto his own and inadvertently lets it grow there. This is yet another  substantial financial hurtle put in the way of the small family farmer  by the power of international business interests. This will again ruin  many small farmers and give agribusiness access to even more cheapened  foreclosed lands.\n\nBesides crippling the small family farmer these  industrial agri-interests likewise don't necessarily put the interests  of the American people first. Rather some concentrate on cultivating  large cash crops for sale in foreign markets; focusing on satiating  outside demand at a profit instead of working to feed the masses of  Americans who struggle to afford nutritious and healthy meals. While  those focused on domestic markets often sell their produce to the large  commercial purveyors of street foods that are lolling our youth into a  fat saturated state of sloven indolence.\n\nWork must thus be undertaken  to undo the great harm caused by the unbarred metastasization of these  industrial agri- and ranching interests and restore our society to the  purity and beauty it once embodied. As such the lands so brazenly  occupied by these liberal marketeers over about two centuries should be  returned to the people. The most effective way to accomplish this would  be through a staggered process of land expropriation that would see  these corporations' mammoth domains divided up and parceled out as  private property to the influx of new rural residents that would  coincide with the implementation of the the aforementioned re-ruralizing  policies.\n\nHowever to avoid the perils of Marxism it may be necessary to recognize that some of these interests *may have*  made material improvements in the condition of these lands and to  provide them with some form of basic compensation. Those corporations  best suited to the task will thus be reformed under law into agencies  with the right to re-educate the new rural populations in the practices  of agriculture and livestock rearing, funded and strictly overseen by  the state. The rest, being unfit for this purpose, will be dissolved and  their assets seized.\n\nIn this vision of agrarian reform the nationalization of the **farm credit system**  would also be necessary so as to take it out of the hands of  its  current masters, agribusiness profiteers. Nominally under the authority  of the independent federal Farm Credit Administration this group  functions as a farming Federal Reserve; owned by its members and  controlling the financing of all rural commercial initiatives in the  country with limited independent oversight. Indeed half of the FCA's  board is appointed by this lobby group.\n\nIn contrast what we need is  an agricultural support regime under the direct authority of the state  through this same agency, with the recipients of such government largess  unable to appoint their own overseers. As part of this general reform  the system's “Federal” Land Banks and Intermediate Credit Banks along  with their respective districts should be kept in place. With these  bodies helping to facilitate the purchase of further real property and  farming implements once the initial bouts of re-ruralization have been  completed. Meanwhile the system's District Banks for Cooperatives would  eventually be wound down in as much as when state aid for family farmers  becomes sufficiently plentiful agricultural cooperatives will become  obsolete.\n\nThe process for attaining credit under these new conditions  will be simplified by the removal of the requirement to buy stock in  any number of Land Bank or Production Credit associations in order to  receive a loan. The previous system's practice of granting control of  said organizations to their biggest stockholders (i.e. biggest debtors)  will come to an end. This approach marginalized small farmers and  empowered those with the excess capital required to purchase influence  in such organizations, that is the liberal marketeers who direct  industrial agribusiness. These changes will thus see the shuttering of  said associations and an end to their control not only over the  financing of all agricultural enterprises in the country, but  additionally the erasure of their erstwhile authority over America's  wider agricultural policy.\n\nAs greater numbers of people become  increasingly self sufficient in terms of food production the marketing  and business services cooperatives that function as extensions of the  Banks for Farm Cooperatives will also be phased out. This because large  scale merchandising of foodstuffs will become redundant except for  governmental purposes. These include provisioning for the armed forces  and the creation of food stockpiles for emergency purposes. These  necessities are well known and have no need to be marketed to in the  present coarse fashion.\n\nAt the moment much of the financial support  garnered for the functioning of these various bodies is acquired through  the floating of securitized debt instruments to the public. However, as  the entirety of this mechanism will be brought under the direct  auspices of the central government this practice too will be terminated.  In place of such revenue sources the system will receive support  directly from the state. Whereas the people are now held liable for any  losses incurred by the decisions of the merchant-chieftains who lead  these groups without any real authority over them, under this  revitalization of ruralism the state will be at once both accountable  for such failures and capable of guiding policy in a manner more  conducive to the true flowering and sustainability of the rural economy.\n\nWith  such financing and governance issues resolved this new agricultural  aide regime will be free to grant farmers who are struggling the  assistance they really need. Operating loans will  regularly be renewed,  unless there is some grave malfeasance, allowing farmers to plan for the  long term and no longer live in fear of farm bankruptcy. Loans will  never more be granted which expose the small family farmer to the  vagaries of financial markets, with adjustable rate financing eliminated  and all loans granted at below market rates in order to give those who  work with their hands and actually produce the leeway they need to  survive. While smaller farmers who incorrectly followed the example of  the liberal marketeers and engaged in classes of production dependent on  large mass markets, such as dairy and soy farming, will receive special  incentives to diversify away from said practices. That said the  accompanying margin-protection insurance programs that went along with  such practices        will also be dismantled.   In order to guarantee strict  oversight of these agencies and further the goal of restoring our society to its former strength a dramatic transformation of the form and  usage of national government will be required. Parts of what are now  federal departments will be eliminated while their remainders in some  cases will have to be conglomerated to facilitate a better co-ordination  of the processes necessary to see this great goal through. For example,  the creation of a Department for Housing and Re-ruralization comprised  of element from the former departments of agriculture, housing and urban  development and education as well as the EPA.     \n\nTo accomplish this  we will need the work of a strong unflinching government, perhaps much  mightier than anything our current system is capable of producing. Our  federalist government with its constant alterations of rule by misguided  and selfish cliques could likely never accomplish a social  transformation as grand as the one discussed here. Both its inability to  develop and implement long range plans and in many respects its  beholdeness to international business interests suggest a change in the  structure and makeup of our government will be required to see these  changes set in motion. What we need is a form of government free of the  corrosive social inclinations that accompanied the 'modernization' and  mechanization of society.\n\nIn short what we need is a monarchy; a  government unafraid to take the reins and guide society in a direction  all too often ignored and looked down upon by those who have told us  they have all the answers. These people have failed to secure the true  well being of our people in many ways. Whether in terms of employment,  where just as with the introduction of mechanization we are suffering  from mass joblessness (at about 28% according to the government's own  figures), or as regards our health, bombarded as we are with the harmful  chemical cocktails that swirl about us both in our rural and non-rural  settings.\n\nEscaping from the toxic mileau manipulated into existence  over the past few centuries will be a daunting long term process. It  will take generations to complete and entail in many ways a complete  reconsideration of how our society is organized and run. The challenge  is great but even greater is the will to see the wrongs of the past  undone, This is a struggle in which we can not fail. And indeed once we  marshal all the resources of society to our side there can be no doubt  that we will together restore society to its true equilibrium, where man  is again free from the toils and corruptions of modernism just as God  intended.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/r6kvsx/the_urbangreen_paradox/

I am having trouble finding resources on the impacts of these kinds of plants on things such as air and water pollution.  Nearly all of the easily found information is about the impacts of mining lithium and cobalt, not on the manufacture of the batteries.  If anyone can point me in the right direction I'd be grateful.  I am all for EVs and actually have two myself so I'm not opposed to the plant but I want to be educated on the issues as it moves forward.  I suspect that the local officials will overlook any potential impacts that should be remediated while they have dollar signs in their eyes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/r7bhke/environmental_impacts_of_lithium_ion_battery/

I have created an app that integrates smart money management with eco-conscious spending.,"I and my team have created an app that shows the impact of your everyday spending on the climate while making money management simpler and less tedious. It will be possible to **track your carbon footprint** in near real-time. Additionally, it will be possible to **offset and reduce the footprint** through low-carbon alternatives.\n\nThe objective is to make carbon footprint more ubiquitous by linking it to money and hence **driving more awareness of the impact of spending on the climate**.\n\nWe are on the verge of launching a beta of this app for the UK market. I believe such an app **may be useful for many eco-conscious individuals on this forum**.\n\nI would **love to get some feedback** on this app and improve it to make it more useful for people in this community and like-minded individuals.\n\nYou can find out more about what we are doing at: [**https://wyzr.uk**](https://wyzr.uk/) .
