This unfortunately means that the federal government is no longer enforcing laws over many other waters, including groundwater, wetlands that are not adjacent to large bodies of water, some seasonal streams that flow for only a portion of the year,  and “ephemeral” streams that only flow after rainstorms. Here’s what the means!"

Found Russian salmon that is processed in China. It is labeled as sustainable but for the life of me I cannot find toxicity findings for this salmon fished from what is called Russian waters.  Mercury, PCB and other run off from Russian Industry off their Pacific coast, (Is where I guess is what they are calling, Russian Waters, wild caught.)  It's skin on too, which is great for Omega 3 but also can contain the high levels of contamination if present in the water.  Also understanding the life cycle of these salmon is are they born in polluted rivers before migrating into the ocean.  And had radioactivity from Japan entered the waters too. Good God now I'm depressed!!!  I won't buy more if I cannot verify the toxicity,  oh well, their is always typical stinky azz American grocery store sardines.

We’ve heard about the effects a high-sugar, high-fat diet can have on our health, yet we shouldn’t overlook the impact of our dietary choices on the environment.\n\nFrom growing crops to packaging and transporting goods, up to a third of all greenhouse gas emissions come from the agriculture sector. As Australia (and Victoria) become more environmentally conscious, veganism has surged, with a portion of our population adhering to a strict plant-based diet.\n\nHowever, to make sustainable and consistent dietary changes, they must be achievable in small, everyday changes that anyone can adopt into their eating habits.\n\nClick this post to learn more about how to eat sustainably: [https://kaushiksridhar.com/2020/03/01/eat-sustainably/](https://kaushiksridhar.com/2020/03/01/eat-sustainably/)"

We may also be eating too much meat and we will have to compromise. We are not climate deniers we know it's a serious problem, but we also think it's all about innovation.

My remaining choices seem to be the Libertarians and the Greens, and I feel about halfway at home in each.\n\nI like the libertarian approach toward individual civil liberties, free trade, and open borders, but their private-ownership approach to land and natural resources is, IMO, a recipe for disaster on both the economic and ecological fronts.\n\nAs for the Greens, on the broadest level, I see the Four Pillars and Ten Key Values as being absolutely compatible with my geoist beliefs, and I endorse them completely. But I part ways with the GPUSA in the policies they propose (a lot of state action, income taxes and so on) to realize those values. Basically, I think the Green goals are great, but I would advocate other means for achieving them.\n\nWould someone like me have a place in the Green Party?

flk8aq,"Plastics, Fossil Fuels, and Fast Fashion are damaging our environment...But there is one super plant that could have the solution.   \n\n\n“Hemp. Aka the most versatile plant on the planet. Hemp is the only plant that can feed you, clothe you, create a home for you, and provide you with natural beauty products.”Source: MindBodyGreen.org \n\nWe are all becoming much more aware of our impacts on the environment, and there is a lot of talk about how to cut down plastic use, slow down fast fashion, and alternative fuels for cars. Well, i'm here to let you know that there is one plant that could be the answer to all of these problems, and more! \n\nThat plant is hemp. \n\nHemp cultivation is becoming more widespread, and as more hemp is grown, it is becoming a highly regarded resource to help make the world a more sustainable and eco friendly place.  Hemp is super multifunctional and has proved itself one of the most versatile natural fibres out there. \n\n“Hemp has been cultivated on planet earth for over 10,000 years. It has been an important source of food and fibre with references dating back to ancient China and Mesopotamia. Applications of hemp plants evolved from simple rope and coarse woven fabric to paper and sail cloth.” Source : HempTrade.ca \n\nDid you know? As a farmer in parts of the USA in the 1600s, it was actually mandatory to grow Hemp on a percentage of your land. Each farmer had to dedicate land specifically to Hemp because it was so widely used. This sadly changed when the government ruled it an illegal plant due to its association with the cannabis plant. \n\nHere's a list of current and up and coming uses for the super plant: \n\nClothes - Yup. Brands such as Hempton Apparel are now bringing out hemp clothing, it is perfect for clothes because is is durable, resistant to odour, UV protective, breathable, comfy, and moisture wicking. \n\nHemp oil - Hemp oil has many uses and benefits, people swear by it. In fact, it has started to become so popular in Australia, there have been cases of it selling out and being hard to get hold of. Hemp oil contains Omega 3 and Omega 6 which are said to help inflammation, so many people with arthritis are using it.  \n\nHemp moisturiser and skin care - Hemp is used in face moisturisers, and even to help with the aging process, and help treat acne. \n\nNutrition - Hemp seeds are becoming routine in the diets of many health conscious people. Why? It is great protein (popular in vegans and vegetarians), it also contains Omega 3 and 6 fatty oils, Omega 9, Minerals (Calcium, Iron, Magnesium), and Vitamins.\n\nFood - Not only can you get hemp seeds, and hearts, but people are starting to experiment with hemp in food more, such as Hemp burgers! \n\nHemp milk - Yup. There’s a new contender for non dairy milk. Hemp milk is pretty darn good for you too. It is lactose, soy, and gluten free and high in fatty acids and proteins. It is very nutritious, and people have even started making it themselves at home. \n\nHempcrete - Hemp has been used as a replacement for concrete for many years as I found out last year, and is now becoming increasingly in demand. \n\nI’m certainly no expert in hempcrete, concrete or any other elements of construction, so here's a bit on hempcrete from a far more knowledgeable source:\n\n“It has great energy efficiency. It maintains a steady temperature. It doesn't shrink, so there are no crack lines. It is a breathable material.”  Source: Houseplanninghelp.com \n\nRope - One of the oldest uses for hemp, possibly the original.  Hemp has been used in rope in all kinds of trades, but is famous for its uses in shipping. \n\n“In 1997, a hemp rope dating back to 26900 BC was found in Czechoslovakia, making it the oldest known object to be associated with cannabis.” Source: Ancient Origins \n\nSoap - Hemp is known to be gentle on sensitive skin, as well as being moisturising, so it makes the perfect ingredient for natural soap. \n\nFuel - Hemp biofuel is being discussed as a possibility. As we are becoming more conscious and trying to remove the use of fossil fuels, scientists are looking for a way to make an environmentally and sustainable fuel, and hemp is being talked about a lot right now, so watch this space! \n\nSunscreen - With it’s natural UV protection properties, and it's moisturising feeling, it has started to be used in making sunscreen, and with much less harmful ingredients, compared with some other options on the market. \n\nBeer - Heck yes. Hemp beer is on the market. Gluten free, vegan friendly beer with hemp in it. Because, why not?! \n\nPet food - Because we can’t keep this hemp goodness all to ourselves - It’s great for our pets too! There is currently cat and dog food enriched with hemp oil, and some brands have been recommended by vets. \n\nPet bedding - A safe, natural option for pet bedding, which offers comfort as well as antimicrobial properties. \n\nPaper - Hemp paper has been around for years - in fact it can be traced back to around 200 BC in China. \n\nInteresting Fact:\n\nThe first draft of the declaration of independence was written on hemp paper.\n\nProtein powder -  I must admit, nutrition definitely isn't one of my expertise so I looked over a few websites to learn a bit more about this. Turns out hemp protein powder is meant to be pretty good. \n\n“Hemp protein powder is a high-quality plant-based protein that contains 20 amino acids — the building blocks of protein. Protein is crucial for developing, growing and maintaining muscles, tissues and vital organs. It also helps boost metabolism and increases fat-burning.” \n\nYoursuper.com \n\nNappies/diapers - Hemp nappies for babies are becoming a big thing. The main reasons hemp is so good for diapers are; It is environmentally friendly (we already know this), it’s baby friendly - the fabric is tested and certified to be safe to use on young babies and children, it’s durable, it’s soft, it’s stretchy, and it’s absorbent. \n\nTo clean soil - I talked about this in a post recently, but it's a valid one for this list, and I love talking about it, because I just think it’s so wonderful. Hemp produces high quantities of biomass, which returns to the soil and decomposes, giving nutrients back into the soil.  Not only that but it also is also able to absorb heavy metals and pollutants (Phytovolatilization). \n\nAn example of this is:\n\nHemp was used to help clean up after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in  Ukraine in 1986, due to its ability to absorb radioactive toxins from the ground.\n\nShoes - This is quite a new thing as far as i can tell, but i’ve seen a couple of brands of sneakers coming out with hemp trainers, as a vegan, and sustainable option. \n\nPlastic - This is beginning to be talked about. The idea of plastic being replaced with ‘bioplastics’, including hemp as one of the runners. \n\nCars - Believe it or not, this is actually a piece of history, which may well make a comeback. Henry Ford made a prototype hemp car back in 1941, which was also designed to run on hemp fuel. If you read up, it seems that it may also become a thing of the future... I think Mr Ford was definitely well ahead of his time there, and onto something. Time will tell. \n\nI really believe this is just the beginning for hemp, it’s a fibre that has a highly growing market, and now you know why. You’ll be hearing about hemp a lot more in future.  Hopefully it really can help to turn this environmental crisis around, because its negative impacts are generally much less than current material we are overusing. \n\nPretty impressive hey? If you know of any other uses for this magnificent plant, please comment below, I'd love to hear of any others you may have. Let me know what you think. \n\nI have just made my own brand of hemp shirts, which I am currently crowdfunding to help get off the ground.  They are available now on Kickstarter, check out the link here to snap one up at our Kickstarter prices. \n\n[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hempton/hempton-super-plant-sustainable-t-shirt-endure-adventure](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hempton/hempton-super-plant-sustainable-t-shirt-endure-adventure)\n\nThanks for reading! \n\nHannah \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A beautiful plant - Hemp ](https://preview.redd.it/73lafq53rpn41.jpg?width=4912&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06d1d5d7368f1e2955c8555b2e6644c62ab3fb8e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Hemp field after harvest ](https://preview.redd.it/8v5zral4rpn41.jpg?width=2896&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f07462788dfa4c77c9137f7c44cb29d01466f18f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Hemp growing](https://preview.redd.it/fawzpdb6rpn41.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de16ad022e11b3dc74b7a990dae43d23fd11e7bf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Hemp shirts ](https://preview.redd.it/ndjnohh8rpn41.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca0f21451fb357288a32e92cc52040dc087cd339)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Could hemp cars and fuel become the new norm?](https://preview.redd.it/f6ltfjvdrpn41.jpg?width=8256&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cd994ff8f48178438c6bf48e2da2f52ce87cf50)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Hemp is grown organically ](https://preview.redd.it/bl4aojvjrpn41.jpg?width=3456&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7016e38dbaf0fe5d8f9a7a0bad4cba797e77f9f0)"

Before this crash we were is a situation where Biden would help the climate. In a world where it's 2021 Biden is the POTUS and the economy is that of 2019. Biden would be willing to moderately help the climate. \n\nHowever, considering the economy we will have in 2021. Biden will be willing to spend little to nothing to fight global warming.\n\nAm I wrong? Am I dumb, mislead or confused? If so please teach me how that's so. I'm very willing to listen. But, as far as I can tell Biden was already a moderate (at best) on every issue. And he is the type of guy to put the economy over the climate. Is he not that? Am I wrong about him? At best he might cut important government safety nets (like social security) to fund fighting global warming.\n\nPresident Biden could easily end up crushing what little popularity the dem party has. Then we could easily get 8 years of a republican president, after 4 years of Biden. Because Biden will probably not know how to manage the mess Trump leaves him. He very might cut popular government programs for reasons I would say are bad. So I could easily imagine a massive number regretting voting for him over Trump. Because of the mess Trump leaves  him. And him failing to manage it well. That's how it seems to me anyway. Again please correct me if you think I'm wrong."

The core teams shall calculate the carbon, water, and ecological footprint for their community (by surveying the residents) using our database of user-friendly environmental calculators. After this simple data collection, the core team will analyse and identify the largest environmental problem in their community. Then they will use our resources and collaborate with the organization’s executive board to plan and implement community-based strategies to address this problem and measure impact.\n\n You are welcome to initiate and lead a chapter in your region, form a core team locally, and get going! We're going to be supporting you in the process.\n\n\nIf not interested in chapters, you can join one or more of the following teams that are being formed-\n\n1. Bloggers on anything related to environmental sustainability, ranging anywhere from lifestyle tips to analytical articles. \n\n2. Social media experts and outreach managers who would be integral to showcasing the mission and accomplishments. \n\n3.

This is one of the 21st century's biggest deals worth hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars, and where accurate information is essential for investors. You can always find pro green energy numbers that tell a very different story, depending on what they loosely define as green energy. I.E. - burning trees and palm oil and calling it green energy doesn't make it so. Dams cause methane emissions and kill river life, but they are called green. To get enough algae ponds for one third of electricity demand would require enough land about the size of Argentina. The only thing people lie about more than climate is energy.\n\nAll your climate and energy charts on one single page:\n\n* [https://lokisrevengeblog.wordpress.com/collpase-charts/](https://lokisrevengeblog.wordpress.com/collpase-charts/)"

But since my wife and I are both working from home these days our water bill has risen. Not substantially, but enough to notice. Water bills are usually rather inexpensive so I'm not as much worried about the increase in money, just the increase in water consumption. Which we probably were using it before but someone else was fronting the bill so it never occurred to me. I know the increase is from toilet flushes. We both drink a lot of water throughout the day which results in lots of trips to the bathroom. \n\nI havent done this, but I recall in the past reading something about adding things to your tank to basically take up additional space in the tank so there's less room for water but it still will rise to the normal level, such as a brick. Is something like this a good idea or is that just asking for problems to creep in? \n\nI've tried only flushing every few times I go, but wife is not as much on board with that method so I'm searching for an alternative just to reduce the amount of water used. Who knows maybe it's not worth it in the long run, but figured it was worth asking.\n\nThanks!"

Connected to utility grid that's a mix of natural gas turbines and renewable solar/wind source energy. Also have natural gas lines installed in house.  Electrical panel fairly new with 200 amp max load.

I immediately have the ability to wire a car charger for an EV (hoping to buy in 2021) , and oven/range setup. Will sell the gas range to a used appliance store and purchase a new induction stove.\n\nIf you are looking for a new range- induction is the future. Quicker, cleaner, safer, better indoor air quality.\n\nNext in line: replacing the older furnace when it craps out with a dual AC/Heat pump and gas dryer to heat pump dryer.\n\nDown the road: replace gas water heaters with electric. They are relatively new and will likely last. Repair appliances myself when possible or financially reasonable,  replace fridge, dish, washer, etc. with energy efficient models when the time arises. \n\nSorry if all disorganized,  on mobile.

jewzlm,"Ecopin - a social media platform with an environmental focus launches on kickstarter! Ecopin is my concept for a social media platform that incorporates a ""social mapping system"" to encourage social media users to go out and participate in their local community. The social map allows users to create and view ""pins"" on a local map. These pins include everything going on in the community, from farmers markets to protests. The two goals of this mapping system are to make users aware of environmental threats that are hidden in their local community and  strengthen local communities through the creation and increased turnout to local events. That being said, it would not be wise to release an app like this during a pandemic, so for now we are focusing on the development on the app so it can hopefully be finished when things are finally going back to normal (who knows when that will be.)\n\nThe second part of the app is a normal social media platform like any other, but the difference is that Ecopin will care for it's users, and not exploit them. There will be no spying or selling of private information, divisive behavior will be extremely discouraged and there will be a large focus on preventing trolls and fake accounts from getting in. Another difference is that while advertisement will exist, it will only be for local and green businesses, unlike other social platforms that give advertisement to the highest bidder (no greenwashing allowed.)\n\n[Here is the landing page with information on the project](http://ecopin.org/index.html)\n\n[Here is the interactive design prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/d4c3249e-8164-48e8-4274-17fae90cd18e-a2f2/screen/a94a6981-1911-4297-84a5-491dcb08fbfb/?fullscreen)\n\n[and here is the kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1870061924/ecopin?ref=discovery&amp;term=ecopin)\n\nI decided to kickstart the project because I need to gather a motivated team of programmers, designers, environmental experts and team leaders. I gathered a small group of programmers passionate about the environment and interested in the project and we managed to start the prototyping process, but all of them have full time jobs and could only dedicate so much time to the project. If you personally have an interest in helping out or giving advice feel free to message me. \n\nI am open to any and all questions on the project, so feel free to comment away any thoughts that come to mind when reading about it! :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/04du1yv8zau51.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f14f865b9eca9d67b1fc38add7098281e2b55fb6"

Recently she has been spearheading this operation and has brought a lot of new ideas into our household, but it left her a bit lost. \n\nFor a few years now she thought she wanted to make a career out of being an artist and she has spent a lot of time learning how to paint &amp; watercolor, draw, and use digital art.\n\nNow she has a hard time painting, drawing, or doing anything art related because she feels she is wasting paper. She is also worried that a career as an artist means contributing towards consumerism and waste.\n\nMy personal opinion is that art and expression is what makes life worth living, and that the world needs artists. I havent done much research into how sustainable the printing industry is, but I would imagine that whatever toll it takes on the planet is worth it in the end if it's for art. \n\nSelling designs on products may be a different story, but again i think if its a reusable/sustainable product or a necessity (ex: clothing) that it might not be such a bad thing.\n\nDo you agree or disagree with this? Any research, articles, or just personal opinions and stories supporting either side would be incredibly helpful.

juvhbj,"Some of my thoughts on how to improve the environment The only way to make carbon capture technologies better is to test and iterate on carbon capture technologies. They are no magic bullet, but they are part of the toolkit we have for mitigating climate catastrophe. Renewable energy was totally unrealistic 30 years ago, solar sucked, and the wind sucked. It was totally economically and spatially infeasible, but investments and development and innovation have made renewables cheaper in some areas compared to fossil fuels, with even more potential avenues of development being walked down. Comparing carbon capture tech of today to the issues, we will have is kind of like comparing the first artificial hamburger cost to the price of a hamburger today. Yes, the first artificial hamburger was extraordinarily expensive, costing like 100000 dollars or something like that, but it was simply a proof of concept, and the price+efficiency of the artificial meat process has gotten better dramatically in only a few years. Of course, I can't promise even that level of success with carbon capture, only say that it is absolutely a route worth pursuing."

Hi all,\n\nI’m part of a small group of students on a “build your own product” course and we’re really keen to understand how those engaged with the environment think of their behaviour in relation to their carbon footprint. Is Carbon Footprint reduction really something that shapes decisions?\n\nWe're in a bit of a rush as we need some answers for tomorrow, so would hugely appreciate any answers and would love to share back the findings to participants as well! We'd ask that you write 1-2 lines on the below (more if you like!):\n\n* What is a carbon footprint to you?\n* What would you want to know about your carbon footprint?\n* How much of a priority is climate change in your life?\n* What difference do you feel you could have on the overall carbon footprint?\n* Tell me of a time you did something different with climate change in mind?\n* What is stopping you making changes to reduce your carbon footprint?\n\nAppreciate your wisdom, gang!"

I'm looking for any other Republican-written bills that were either anti-Green, pro-corporate to a fault, or just plain rotten, and were eventually passed by Democratic-majority bodies.

lmijz0,"The world's first large-scale production of wooden towers for wind power will soon start in Sweden. The hope is to further increase the sustainability of wind power. [Source](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/medvind-for-svenska-tratorn)\n\n&gt;The world's first large-scale production of wooden towers for wind power will soon start in Sweden. The hope is to further increase the sustainability of wind power.\n\n\n&gt;As recently as May last year, Modvion's first wooden tower was erected on Björkö outside Gothenburg. Now the world's leading wind turbine manufacturer becomes Danish Vestas' partner in the company, with the aim of introducing wooden towers in its product line to reduce its climate footprint. This means new factories and more employees at Swedish Modvion, which today has a development factory in Gothenburg.\n\n\n&gt;- In this way, we get more Swedish jobs, more renewable delivery from wind power and also show that it is possible to build really demanding dynamic applications of laminated wood, says Otto Lundman, CEO and co-founder of Modvion.\n\n\n&gt;Individual wind turbines have been built in the world in wood in the past, but this construction is planned to be manufactured on a large scale. The hope is to be able to build hundreds of towers per year in just a few years.\n\n\n&gt;**Plywood of spruce**\n\n\n&gt;The wood used in the production is a kind of plywood of Swedish spruce, a material that is stronger by weight than steel and will be able to provide cheaper production, according to the company. According to their calculations, carbon dioxide emissions are reduced by about 30 percent during the construction of a wind turbine with laminated wood towers, compared with a standard steel structure.\n\n\n&gt;**Has managed peak load**\n\n\n&gt;The tower that was erected on Björkö is part of a test wind turbine operated by the Swedish Wind Power Technology Center at Chalmers University of Technology. Several research projects are already underway on the construction and what it stands for.\n\n\n&gt;- It has gone as expected, in some cases above expectations. The greatest load on the tower is when the wind turbine is stationary and there is a storm outside. So we have already tried the peak loads on the tower and it can handle it without further ado. The next step is to examine how well the material works in the long run.\n\n\n&gt;One strength of the design is that it is built in modules. This makes shipping much easier and also opportunities to transport tower parts with a larger diameter than before. It also creates good conditions for being able to build towers for over 200 meters high wind turbines - perhaps over 300 meters in the long run, according to Modvion's CEO Otto Lundman."

He has spent 30 years of his life planting trees to save his island, creating a forest and restoring its wildlife.All of this began when he was just a little boy. One day the boy went to the local palmist and he prophesied that Jadav’s life will take the course of Nature.\n\nHis story begins in1979.\n\nAfter a devastating flood, he found MANY DEAD snakes on the shore. They died from the heat, since the bank was absolutely deserted, and there was not a single tree that could give them shade, and no  opportunity to return back to the saving river.He wondered what it would look like if the same  happened to humans — the island was being eroded very quickly.\n\nWhat he saw deeply shocked Jadav, he decided to change the situation and make the river bank habitable.He first planted only 20 bamboo seedlings to see if they could take root. The bamboo took root and turned green, so Jadav continued to plant trees. He decided to live in the newly planted forest, looking after it, and planting more and more new territories around with trees.\n\nYou can also watch a video here [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBFuTwdhuINsF6ZjETXsHRQ?sub\_confirmation=1](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBFuTwdhuINsF6ZjETXsHRQ?sub_confirmation=1)"

If you are not living the life of an Amish, you are contributing to carbon emissions. I only use the internet to relay this message. To tell everyone we need to give up everything. Cars, computers, cellphones, grocery stores, electricity, etc. Traveling to Lansing will only cause carbon emissions. Unless you ride a bike there, but even a bike needs to be made and shipped. Turn away from electricity, our world depends on it!\n\nThank you for your consideration."

In 2018, US $ 167 billion were issued globally in these instruments. What is relevant about this figure is that ten years ago they practically did not exist.\n\nBetween January and November 2019, Global Green Bond issuances exceeded $ 200 billion, setting a new record, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI). This body forecasts that by the end of this year it will reach 250,000 million US dollars and also estimates that in 2030 projects related to climate change will require an investment of approximately 90 billion US dollars.\n\nSeveral factors are contributing to the boom in this rising market. One of them is a greater participation of new corporate issuers in Europe, America and Asia. The Green Bond market has been experiencing exponential growth since the latest years.\n\nClick to read the full article: https://gbm.news/companies-eyes-on-green-bonds/"

[**We don't sell polyester**](https://thefashionadvocate.com/blogs/news/were-committed-to-a-more-sustainable-slow-fashion-future-so-we-no-longer-sell-polyester) fashion and we advocate for sustainable, slow, ethical fashion. We also operate with a [**'10 value system'**](https://thefashionadvocate.com/blogs/ethical-and-sustainable-fashion-online/ethics-sustainability), and all of our brands share a minimum of three of our ten values.\n\nDoing our part to have a positive fashion impact is important to us, so every year we commit to one major sustainability change for the better. Last year, it was ditching polyester fashion. Why? Because 63% of fashion is now made with polyester, a synthetic fabric produced with petrochemicals and non-renewable resources. It's a nasty, environmentally devastating fabric, and it has no place in our wardrobes.\n\nNearly 70 million barrels of oil are used each year to make the world's use of polyester, and oil is a non-renewable resource. Once it's gone, it's gone. Polyester garments also take more than 200 years to break down, but they never decompose; tiny plastic particles exist forever.\n\nSo, what's the solution? Ditch polyester and switch to natural, biodegradable, renewable fabrics in your wardrobe, and choose to shop ethically and sustainably.\n\nThere are plenty of sustainable alternatives to polyester fast fashion. Natural fabrics like cotton, hemp, silk and Tencel are better for the environment, less energy-intensive, biodegradable, and they're a healthier option to wear too. The skin is the largest organ, so everything we put on it, goes in it, including the chemicals found in our clothing - another great reason to boycott polyester.\n\nREAD: [https://thefashionadvocate.com/blogs/news/four-ethical-and-sustainable-fabric-alternatives-to-polyester-fast-fashion](https://thefashionadvocate.com/blogs/news/four-ethical-and-sustainable-fabric-alternatives-to-polyester-fast-fashion)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ilhvwktlrvr61.png?width=1246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab2ca6395f684364e77b7564cfe5ce2614d63bef"

mz9t3e,"Academic survey regarding Smart Meter usage Hi, this is a questionnaire for my undergraduate paper. My paper is looking at design improvements for smart meters in hopes to create more beneficial behaviour from its users by encouraging sustainable living. This is aimed to be implemented by creating a more friendly and helpful UI on the smart meter via an app that will help the consumer to closely track their spending on gas, electric and water usage. Furthermore, a potential points-based system may help to encourage users, and this questionnaire will allow me to see the viability of that idea. I am mainly looking for responses from those with Smart Meters at home. \n\n[https://forms.gle/BgWKYsFmZdfeLr199](https://forms.gle/BgWKYsFmZdfeLr199)\n\nNo personal information is collected for this but feel free to contact me for any further information.

There are sooo many ways for consumers to be more eco-conscious but it could be overwhelming for most people which is why they're not taking any action. \n\nWe would absolutely love to work with this community on the product, there are incredible people here and we're sure we could get valuable insights.\n\nPlease reach out if you want to learn more or help.\n\nThanks!"

oef96n,"People laughed at him when he was planting trees in the desert! But later on everyone was amazed Jadav Payeng is known as a Forest Man of India. He has spent 30 years of his life planting trees to save his island, creating a forest and restoring its wildlife.All of this began when he was just a little boy. One day the boy went to the local palmist and he prophesied that Jadav’s life will take the course of Nature.\n\nHis story begins in1979.\n\nAfter a devastating flood, he found MANY DEAD snakes on the shore. They died from the heat, since the bank was absolutely deserted, and there was not a single tree that could give them shade, and no  opportunity to return back to the saving river.He wondered what it would look like if the same  happened to humans — the island was being eroded very quickly.\n\nWhat he saw deeply shocked Jadav, he decided to change the situation and make the river bank habitable.He first planted only 20 bamboo seedlings to see if they could take root. The bamboo took root and turned green, so Jadav continued to plant trees. He decided to live in the newly planted forest, looking after it, and planting more and more new territories around with trees.\n\nYou can also watch a video here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xKR7Nk7rbg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xKR7Nk7rbg)"

I'm excited for this as I have been interested in the four pillars of sustainability, especially with the increase in manufactured single use waste in the last 18 months.\n\nIt's free so I just wanted to share this here as I thought many of you might be interested as well. Maybe I'll see some of you there!\n\n[https://www.eventbrite.com/e/four-levels-of-action-for-sustainability-with-guest-speaker-mike-janssen-tickets-162815881685](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/four-levels-of-action-for-sustainability-with-guest-speaker-mike-janssen-tickets-162815881685)"
opfiag,"If recycling is a scam, then what should I do?! *Before we begin, I should make clear that I'm not US-based. Sorry for the eventual mistakes, hope I can communicate well regardless.*  \n**\*TL;DR AT THE END.**\n\nSo... first things first. since earlier this year, I have been consuming more and more information about climate change, sustainability, these important kind of things - and it has led me to be more environment-conscious than ever.   \nThing is: I live in a rather dysfunctional home. I'm 22, and (unfortunately!) still live with my parents, who are... how should I say... *less than fun* to live with. They are very difficult people for a whole lot of reasons, but I'll stick to the earth-damaging bit here. \n\n**MOTHER**  \nMy mother is freaky about cleaning everything all the time to the point that it often becomes unhealthy. Almost like by consequence, she also waste very, VERY much paper and plastic. And a lot more things, to be sincere.  \nWith ""VERY"" I mean: every time she wash her hands she dries it up with paper towel. Every time she drinks water she uses a new disposable plastic cup. Every time she comes home she puts her used clothes in a plastic bag... I could go on and on. She truly is a waste machine.   \nMom is also one of the most arrogant beings that I've ever met — so you know that ""trying to talk her out of it"" is not an option. In fact, I've been there, tried that, was involved in major family ~~havoc~~ conflicts, gave up. Well, using disposable itens is apparently very important for her to feel clean. \n\n**FATHER**  \nI also live with my father, who is (and has always been) a very permissive man. He longs for peace and silence, Mom is very angry, stressed and loud all the time. This situation led him to do everything in his power to keep balance and avoid conflict. Since I was a kid, he's always instructed me to do the same. It means, among **a lot** of other things, that he also does that kind of wasteful things for her. Including things like letting a alcohol-wet paper towel near things, so she knows that the item has already been cleaned up. x)  \nRecently, he became worse. Dad is very prone to any kind of conspiracy, and, in the last couple months, he's been watching videos of a ""professor"" who is — brace yourself! — openly ANTI-SUSTAINABILITY. yes, that man says that ""the lie of sustainability"" will end humanity, that it is a government-communist-globalist project of power/control... well, I don't know details, but I guess you got the point already.  \nSo, problem is: he was already damaging BEFORE he was watching those kind of things, and now he is almost porpusefully wasteful. In fact, he even keeps me from being openly ecofriendly.  \nAlthough he's very different from Mom, he's also very pedant and arrogant in his own way, so trying to talk him out of it is also a no-no. \n\n**WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO**  \nAt this point, you may have guessed that I'm considering moving out as soon as it becomes financially possible for me, which, sadly, can take some time. I need to save around \~$20,000 to safely move out, and it is a LOT of money to reach around here! Oof!  \nWell, truth is that I'll have to stick in here for some more time  — becaus of it, I've been thinking about adopting a harm-reduction-policy. I won't be able to switch to full zero-waste for as long as I'm at my parents, but I'll try to do what I can (without getting involved in any more fights, I hope).  \nSilently using specific cloths for what they love to use paper towels; try to buy things only if strictly necessary and at the highest volume possible, so I can avoid financing more plastic packages; separating the trash so I can send to recycle centers... what, wait. RECYLING IS A SCAM?? WHAT DO I DO, THEN?!  \nI really want to do my part. I'm sure that when I move out I'll be able to be anything that I want, including the ecofriendly independent pretty woman I've wanted to be for so long, but... while I'm here, what the heck should I do (or not do)? I'm looking for little things that I can discreetly incorporate in my routines that should reduce impact — without it being an empty work.  \nThis piece of information about recycling really made me lose perspective on what I should focus on while I'm on this damage-management regimen.   \n\n\n**\*TL;DR:**  I've read that recycling is a scam and I'm not sure on what can I do then. My parents are anti-enviromentalists and keep me from living sustainably. I need input about what can I do to reduce environmental harm when I'm in a situation where I can do almost nothing.   \n\n\n*Disclaimer: please, don't suggest anything in the lines of ""confront them! be courageous!"".*   \n*It may be a weakness of mine, but at the moment I really don't have the mental and physical health to do that anymore. It is always more than stressful and it has never have never been worth it. I'm not in my best self right now, so, I'll try to reduce damage in this part of my life too.*"

But in cases where I do end up with them, I've had an idea in my head about what to do with them.\n\nI figured once I was done with a plastic - or maybe even a glass - bottle I could fill it with soil and bury it in the ground. I thought maybe I could put pictures in them or write little notes and they would almost work like time capsules. Keeping them away from sunlight and wind might mitigate microplastic production.\n\n And I thought that maybe instead of soil I could put all the little bits of plastic that come from normal life - like the weird things that hold tags onto clothes or the junk that held my new electric razor in the box.  I could hang onto the bottle until i fill it with all the little bits of plastic waste and then bury it in the ground. Or would a mix of soil and plastic be good? \n\nAnyone got any thoughts?"

oxkoj3,"Which is the greener air conditioning practice? I watched [this video](https://youtu.be/0f9GpMWdvWI) recently about using your house as thermal energy storage. TL;DW: run your air conditioner at night and super chill your house, then don't run your air conditioner during the day when demand on the grid is high and expensive. If your house is efficient enough, the total energy used shouldn't change much, and you avoid overloading the grid (and your wallet).\n\nI tried this with my house over the past week. I already set the thermostat high during peak time, but my house is less efficient and it still needs to cool for a few hours during that time. With this ""thermal battery"" method, it does reduce how much time is spent cooling during peak hours, but it does add 2-3 hours of use overall per day.\n\nSo my question is: is it greener to use less energy overall, even if during peak; or to use a little more energy overall, but less during peak? I suspect it's the former, but wanted to hear some opinions."

Been reading a lot about the Russian revolution lately and its really fascinating how such a extreme far left fringe ideology such AS bolshevism could get so much support. But it does make sense in a context where everything collapsed and goes to hell around them that more and more people began really listening to this crazy Lenin guy that seemed to predict so much correctly about HOW shit was going to go down long before it happened. (I know it was more complicated than that, but you get where Im going).\n\nI was wondering if the (dark) green movements could exploit some of this effect also. If (when) more and more extreme weather will gradually destabilize western societies, can/will the (dark) Greens be able to ride the chaos and say «we were right all along, now will you let us take over so we can save our planet»?

qi2jle,"why green is the best colour/ from school  \n\nAre you someone who thinks that blue is the best colour? Or red or purple or any others in the rainbow, well if you want the objective answer it’s green. Of course, which colour is the best looking to you might not be objective, but I have Scientific facts and evidence that green is the best colour of them all.\n\nFirst of all, green is the colour of nature and it is everywhere, this suggests that our personal liking of the colour green may be within in us. Green is the most common colour for plants including vital resources like trees which produce oxygen for humans to breathe and wood for us to build with, but trees are not the green plant that is vital to our survival, there are also plants that produce antibiotics which save hundreds of millions of lives. The reason behind green saving so many lives is that before antibiotics existed one cut could be a deaf sentence and think that if you colour green did not exist you or people around would likely die. \n\nAnd now you might be asking (Why are plants green and why must they be that way), well the reason why plants are green is because of a pigment called chlorophyll which can only activate during photosynthesis so then in order for a plant to survive It must be green in some way, of course, their exception with less green on them(mushrooms are not plants they are algae which mean they don’t need sunlight to survive and have another way to get their energy).\n\nIn conclusion, green is the best colour because it is not only, in my opinion, the best-looking colour it is also by far the most important colour for nature and people alike. Plants with a green pigment are used the make antibiotic which when they weren’t invented, one scratch or cut could be a deaf sentence, but with the colour green ten of millions of lives have been saved thanks to the colour green, that is why the colour green is the best."

qir6iw,"KAIN: Green Handbag Line, cruelty free and plant based.  \n\n**October 29, 2021, Brooklyn, New York**\- KAIN, the all new environmentally-friendly luxury handbag line, is live on global crowdfunding platform Kickstarter and raising funds to bring the project to life.\n\nOver the last few decades, there has been increasing awareness and activism about the damage that humans are causing to the environment and the planet. Stores are now filled with ethically made clothing and plant-based meat options are available at restaurants nationwide. One area that has yet to catch up is in the area of true vegan leather. Many “vegan leathers,” as they are often advertised by companies, are actually made of harmful materials such as PVC or Polyurethane; KAIN is taking a revolutionary approach by using a true, plant-based and environmentally friendly material— apple leather a byproduct of the Italian juice industry.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eye2l3grqhw71.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff241c17c96fc363f9e9f3e021af49c77f193799\n\n  \n “There are very few brands that offer a cruelty free handbag with a luxury look, at an affordable price point that aren’t made of hazardous materials. Being bothered by this fact, for both the environment and for our animal friends I wanted to steer the consumers' awareness of this major issue that faces the fashion industry,” says founder and designer Kathleen Walter on the inspiration behind the project. “In a corporate setting I noticed the dismissive reactions in meetings when myself or a colleague would suggest making change for the better whether it be with material or the type of factory. After 10 years of observing this, it felt like it was long overdue that I attempted to make some form of change outside of the workplace.”\n\nTo launch, KAIN is introducing two flagship products— the chain wallet, which can be worn in 4 different ways, and the shoulder bag, which boasts versatility from day to night. All KAIN products are crafted by a committed factory, whose main goals revolve around ethical work practices and the use of recycled materials. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h2o3yp7wqhw71.png?width=1404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f319612da6bf67773f3dba1fad77c906d5e445e1\n\n“We need to normalize environmentally friendly leather alternatives that possess a leather look. Otherwise, brands ranging from fast fashion to mid-price point, will continue to mass produce items that are made of PU and PVC. Progress needs to be made on the availability of ethical leather alternatives,” adds Walter. “With KAIN, my aim is to create an accessible luxury handbag line made entirely of an environmentally friendly and recycled plant-based material.”\n\nKAIN is currently live and available to support on Kickstarter: [www.kickstarter.com/projects/k517/kain](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/k517/kain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pdngy4iyqhw71.png?width=1408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2d6546f4bd6a83086b4cee8edff12820b760d19\n\n**About KAIN**\n\nCreated by designer Kathleen Walter, a graduate of Parsons the New School for Design with a BFA in womenswear. Walters carries over 10 years of experience in the fashion industry designing and developing women's handbags for an array of aesthetics, from brands with a cult following to the commercial and accessible.\n\nFor more information on KAIN please visit: [www.wolf-violet-62l9.squarespace.com](https://www.wolf-violet-62l9.squarespace.com)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w52xcl60rhw71.png?width=866&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2552cdb4ca21a47f64d43b1a5e4b0c6235b3424\n\n\###"

r0ox9n,"The Greens is the party of the elitist interests. The Greens have got to be the most elitist party i have ever known in my life!\n\nAll the Greens, in almost all countries, are the same.\n\nLooking into political graphs, they are consistently speaking for the interests of the urban, the rich, the elite .\n\nThese people man, they do not care about the environment. Greens is NOT a movement of outdoorsmen. Green agenda basically comes down to this: population control. All of their policies aim to reduce human populations, reduce consumption, reduce emissions, and generally reduce human impact on the planet. I am not saying that reduced population is bad, but the way Greens plan their agenda, it seems that what they are after is the extermination of poor people. \n\nThey have no pragmatic plan for balancing the cost of reducing emissions. They will not care if people freeze to death. They are also anti-nuclear, which is a CATASTROPHIC stance for economic and environmental reasons. Its calculated that in Germany thousands of people will die to pollution thanks to the burning of fossils to counter the shutdown of nuclear plants...\n\nThese are the people that cannot see beyond their own fingers....\n\nTheir plans to ban cars is a direct insult to all people who live in rural areas.\n\nThey basically are the party of urbanists who have no direct contact with the environment, blind allegiance to establishment media, and hatred of poor people who cannot afford their grandiose plans.\n\nThe Greens are the caricature of the out of touch urban elite.\n\nTLDR: If you are poor, working class, live in rural area , and vote Greens , you should have your head checked."

r6kvsx,"The Urban-Green Paradox  We've been hearing about the problem of urban sprawl here in the US for  decades now, especially its affects on the environment and proposed  solutions such as mass transit. This would lessen some of the worst  environmental impacts of our modern urban lives, but in some ways it may  actually make the problem worse. Because as you spread transit networks  out to reach more people and tie outlying areas into the wider network  what you are doing is creating more opportunities for what is called by  some “real estate development”, either in already populated places or in  less densely settled areas.  \nThis either adulterates and debases the  beauty and splendor of our natural landscapes for the benefit of a few,  or increases rents and overcrowds areas that are already intensively  settled. This is what leads to the strange combination of circumstances  that are experienced in southern California, urban sprawl and over  crowding. The simple fact is that there are too many people living in  the coastal areas of southern California. It affects our environment,  our health and in all honestly our sanity.\n\nSome good meaning folks  mention and some delusional politicians ramble on about various proposed  solutions to these twin menaces; again mass transit but also limited  driving days and low cost housing projects. All these except the first  are little more than band aids that will fail to solve the problems of  overcrowding, a rising cost of living and environmental degradation.  While as we have discussed the former actually can in the long term make  them worse. Especially because when mass transit networks are over  expanded and new areas come into settlement the number of people living  in these areas who actually end up using mass transit will likely be  fewer than those newcomers who will continue to drive .\n\nIn the long  run our problem isn't that we don't have enough mass transit, it's that  we have too many people living in too close proximity to each other;  whether in southern California, Houston, Philadelphia or Seattle. Our  cities and even our suburbs are overdeveloped and overcrowded, not just  in California but across the country,\n\nTake for example the town of  Ellicott, Maryland. Here flooding of the local river, partly due to the  soil's inability to absorb massive amounts of rainfall, caused streams  of destruction to roll through the town and across our television  screens; with many people's almost entire lives being washed away. This  was partly due to the mass concretezation of vast tracts of land around  the colonial-era town associated with new home and business  construction. And who could forget the trauma of the Lower 9th Ward of  New Orleans. That disaster would not have occurred if businesses and  people had not been allowed to settle in and “develop” an area of land  so clearly fraught with danger, lying as it does below sea level so  close to the coast.\n\nOf course, then there are the chronic health  risks of living in an overcrowded urban or urbanizing area such as  respiratory issues arising from vehicle exhaust as well as cancers and  birth defects due to industrial pollutants. Not only that but a recent  study has suggested that these same pollutants are affecting educational  performance, lowering both math and language scores for children living  in these over-urbanized areas. A perhaps more immediate threat to the  populations of our largest metropolitan regions can be found in the  potential for the endemic spread of the new super bugs we've heard so  much about from doctors and scientists. These being immune to our most  advanced pharmacology could, once a severe enough breakout were to  occur, easily and quickly spread through our most cramped and medically  under served urban centers, with little time for the authorities to act.\n\nBesides  the physical and health risks associated with crowding such large  groups of humanity together there are also the detrimental social  impacts of a life spent imprisoned within the four walls of modernism.  The sterility of the modern office robs man of his birth right, the joy  of dominion over nature, the pride of marking the soil with the work of  his own two hands. Instead he finds himself frozen in place surrounded  by a cadre of gadgets and machines that he is told will solve all his  problems, but in reality turn him into little more than a feckless  child.\n\nIn this debased world of drudgery mankind becomes isolated and  increasingly apathetic. People fill their time with an endless parade  of distractions promoted by those who wish to see them remain shackled  in oblivion. Among these are the vapid crazes of social radicalism  taught in many of our universities, the cult of modern celebrity and  sexual promiscuity.\n\nChained to such an existence we are consumed by presumption. **Always finding ourselves in competition with our neighbors,**  either to have the latest product or pronounce the latest liberal  talking point in order to “keep up with the Joneses”. All this in search  of some specious urbanite utopia where we are told enjoyment will  abound around every corner and we can be free of many of the negative  consequences of our own actions. Of course this world can never truly  exist and the results are a society depressed, obsessed with consumption  and drowning in debt. Enslaved by both big finance and big tech man  knows not where to turn.\n\nThe solution best suited to combat these  ills will seem quite radical to some. It is the mass re-ruralization of  our society, evacuating large swaths of major cities and resettling  those populations in a dispersed manner across the countryside to  embrace a return to the soil that will help us create a stabler, more  sustainable and healthier society. This would clearly be a long and  drawn out process, likely taking decades to accomplish and requiring the  mobilization of enormous amounts of both material and human resources  the likes of which few have ever seen.\n\nThe United States is a country  endowed with abundant natural resources, amongst which are enormous  amounts of arable land and forests. Cultivated acreage makes up only  about 10% of land in our country, with less then 25% of this being used  to grow food. Whereas urban and suburban areas take up only about 3\*\*%**.  If we take into consideration arable lands left fallow or being used  for other purposes there is clearly enough land to accommodate the  surplus populations of our cities and suburbs. Of course this may entail  the movement of substantial population groups out of certain states and  into others as the quality and quantity of arable land varies in  different regions of the country.**\n\n**These  movements could be best accomplished or at least facilitated through a  combination of tax policy and financial incentives. The first step in  this direction would be to discourage urban living, primarily through  the creation of two parallel tax regimes. With the basic tax structure  for revenue collection from individuals maintained essentially in tact  in rural areas, but at lower levels, while both income and property  taxes would in the main rise over time in all non-rural districts. This  will create the initial push factor that will propel a voluntary move  away from the cities. This general policy will also apply to all  companies and corporations involved in non-agricultural sectors of the  economy, with the exception of those involved in the defense industry.  Whereby many will help to undue the damage they have done to the people,  most especially financial, technology and import oriented businesses.**\n\n**These  levies will be used to fund a program of agrarian incentives used to  promote the re-establishment of the small to mid-sized family farm as  the cornerstone of American society, acting as the concomitant      pull  factor to the above mentioned urban and suburban disincentives. Among  the former will be subsidies for the purchase of tools, livestock and  grain supplies that will accompany the initial resettlement of  populations.**\n\n**To  facilitate the creation of new small to mid-sized family farms a regime  of lower property and sales tax rates will be instituted for small rural  landholders and laborers, accompanied by intermittent multi-year tax  holidays on both revenue sources for family farmers. Any financial  shortfalls incurred by the state in furtherance of these policies will  initially be made up for by an increase in both corporate and property  taxes for industrial scale agribusiness and ranching.**  \n**To  help those farmers who are already established an initial cancellation  of debts will also be instituted for family landholders of longstanding  who posses land below a certain acreage threshold, with distinct   qualifications established for the same purpose in regards to small and  mid-sized livestock breeders. Additionally as protection against future  financial predations all family farms and ranchs will be classed among a  new category of business known as a hereditary enterprise, which will  halt the practice of farm foreclosures by putting in place a moratorium  on attempts to mortgage or sell any piece of a family farm.**\n\n **To ensure  the continuity of these systemic reforms the holders of hereditary  enterprises will be required to pass their property down to their eldest  son upon retirement or after passing on.**  \n**These  reforms would go a long way to addressing the grave imbalances caused  by the so-called industrial revolution. The mechanization of farming  being the main culprit in disrupting traditional ruralism. With the  advent of the cotton gin (1793) and especially mechanical harvesters and  threshers (1834) large landowners were in some ways able to cut their  personnel and force all but the most fierce of their subsistence  neighbors off their land. While the urban tycoons who came to prominence  near the same time exploited the new technologies of mechanized weaving  and other once artisanal trades to destroy the cottage industries of  the villages and small towns. This gave these former merchants ineffable  power over their sometime former partners.**\n\n**This  swelled the ranks of the rural unemployed, forcing them to swarm the  cities in search of wage employment. Due to overcrowding and the** ***increase in food prices that followed these changes***  **people actually had a lower standard of living then before. You might  ask yourself, using the logic of the industrial marketeer** ***'But wouldn't the efficiencies caused by mechanization lead to lower prices?'***  **The answer is no, since once industrial farmers purchased these  foreclosed lands they turned their attention to increasing their own  profits instead of continuing to use these lands for the common good**.  They did this by taking them out of cultivation and converting them to animal pasturage. This raised the prices of staple goods while lowering  the price of many of the luxury foods craved by their urban  counterparts, many of which were still out of reach of the average  person. Of course mechanization also lead to an increase in slavery  across the Americas due to the new ease of growing cotton.\n\nThe plight  of the surviving small farmer did not end when he adapted himself to  the exigencies of the modernizing world. Rather he has been slowly  ground under foot by the radical economic and biological convulsions of  what has been praised in liberal history books and international  business circles as the “green revolution.” A sorry manipulation and  homogenization of nature that serves to enrich industrial agribusiness  at the expense of farmers as well as the general public.\n\nThis began  with the introduction of new chemical fertilizers and pesticides that  were touted as increasing crop yields and helping to solve the world's  food crisis. And to a certain extent these technologies did help society  to move towards these goals. But again the unforeseen consequences   of  these developments have in many ways undermined their scanty benefits.  From the higher rate of miscarriages and birth defects among  agricultural workers to the likely carcinogenic nature of some of the  most famous of these products, some of which can be found in our homes,  the long-term health affects of exposure to these substances can be  highly detrimental.\n\nLater came GMOs (genetically modified crops and  livestock) which were meant to be in many cases resistant to disease,  drought and/or pests. The health affects of these products are unclear  while separately the dominance they and their creators exercise over the  agricultural market has led to a serious lack of diversity and security  in our food supply. Societally we've become so dependent on the  production of such a limited number of varieties of foodstuffs that any  future unanticipated outbreak of disease, for which no provision was  made in the genetic makeup of these products, could wipe out vast  amounts of our grain and animal stocks. Leaving us again vulnerable to  food shortages and famine in the long run.\n\nAnd just as with the  advent of mechanization such technologies have had a ruinous affect on  most small farmers. Again it is the large agribusinesses that are best  able to afford the expense involved in implementing these technologies,  whether it be purchasing seeds engineered to produce greater yields of  grain or cows imbued with hormones to produce larger quantities of milk.  They are then able to flood the market with their produce, lowering  prices for all such goods and destroy any profit that the small farmer  may have hoped to gain.\n\nNot only does the family farmer fall a prey  to his larger competitors due to these technologies, but he is also at  times victimized by the large multinationals who develop them. In a step  seemingly aimed at the eventual total monetization of nature some of  these companies have sought and received intellectual property rights  over the seeds they have engineered. This allows for litigation against  any farmer who has seeds from a GMO crop on a neighbor's property blown  onto his own and inadvertently lets it grow there. This is yet another  substantial financial hurtle put in the way of the small family farmer  by the power of international business interests. This will again ruin  many small farmers and give agribusiness access to even more cheapened  foreclosed lands.\n\nBesides crippling the small family farmer these  industrial agri-interests likewise don't necessarily put the interests  of the American people first. Rather some concentrate on cultivating  large cash crops for sale in foreign markets; focusing on satiating  outside demand at a profit instead of working to feed the masses of  Americans who struggle to afford nutritious and healthy meals. While  those focused on domestic markets often sell their produce to the large  commercial purveyors of street foods that are lolling our youth into a  fat saturated state of sloven indolence.\n\nWork must thus be undertaken  to undo the great harm caused by the unbarred metastasization of these  industrial agri- and ranching interests and restore our society to the  purity and beauty it once embodied. As such the lands so brazenly  occupied by these liberal marketeers over about two centuries should be  returned to the people. The most effective way to accomplish this would  be through a staggered process of land expropriation that would see  these corporations' mammoth domains divided up and parceled out as  private property to the influx of new rural residents that would  coincide with the implementation of the the aforementioned re-ruralizing  policies.\n\nHowever to avoid the perils of Marxism it may be necessary to recognize that some of these interests *may have*  made material improvements in the condition of these lands and to  provide them with some form of basic compensation. Those corporations  best suited to the task will thus be reformed under law into agencies  with the right to re-educate the new rural populations in the practices  of agriculture and livestock rearing, funded and strictly overseen by  the state. The rest, being unfit for this purpose, will be dissolved and  their assets seized.\n\nIn this vision of agrarian reform the nationalization of the **farm credit system**  would also be necessary so as to take it out of the hands of  its  current masters, agribusiness profiteers. Nominally under the authority  of the independent federal Farm Credit Administration this group  functions as a farming Federal Reserve; owned by its members and  controlling the financing of all rural commercial initiatives in the  country with limited independent oversight. Indeed half of the FCA's  board is appointed by this lobby group.\n\nIn contrast what we need is  an agricultural support regime under the direct authority of the state  through this same agency, with the recipients of such government largess  unable to appoint their own overseers. As part of this general reform  the system's “Federal” Land Banks and Intermediate Credit Banks along  with their respective districts should be kept in place. With these  bodies helping to facilitate the purchase of further real property and  farming implements once the initial bouts of re-ruralization have been  completed. Meanwhile the system's District Banks for Cooperatives would  eventually be wound down in as much as when state aid for family farmers  becomes sufficiently plentiful agricultural cooperatives will become  obsolete.\n\nThe process for attaining credit under these new conditions  will be simplified by the removal of the requirement to buy stock in  any number of Land Bank or Production Credit associations in order to  receive a loan. The previous system's practice of granting control of  said organizations to their biggest stockholders (i.e. biggest debtors)  will come to an end. This approach marginalized small farmers and  empowered those with the excess capital required to purchase influence  in such organizations, that is the liberal marketeers who direct  industrial agribusiness. These changes will thus see the shuttering of  said associations and an end to their control not only over the  financing of all agricultural enterprises in the country, but  additionally the erasure of their erstwhile authority over America's  wider agricultural policy.\n\nAs greater numbers of people become  increasingly self sufficient in terms of food production the marketing  and business services cooperatives that function as extensions of the  Banks for Farm Cooperatives will also be phased out. This because large  scale merchandising of foodstuffs will become redundant except for  governmental purposes. These include provisioning for the armed forces  and the creation of food stockpiles for emergency purposes. These  necessities are well known and have no need to be marketed to in the  present coarse fashion.\n\nAt the moment much of the financial support  garnered for the functioning of these various bodies is acquired through  the floating of securitized debt instruments to the public. However, as  the entirety of this mechanism will be brought under the direct  auspices of the central government this practice too will be terminated.  In place of such revenue sources the system will receive support  directly from the state. Whereas the people are now held liable for any  losses incurred by the decisions of the merchant-chieftains who lead  these groups without any real authority over them, under this  revitalization of ruralism the state will be at once both accountable  for such failures and capable of guiding policy in a manner more  conducive to the true flowering and sustainability of the rural economy.\n\nWith  such financing and governance issues resolved this new agricultural  aide regime will be free to grant farmers who are struggling the  assistance they really need. Operating loans will  regularly be renewed,  unless there is some grave malfeasance, allowing farmers to plan for the  long term and no longer live in fear of farm bankruptcy. Loans will  never more be granted which expose the small family farmer to the  vagaries of financial markets, with adjustable rate financing eliminated  and all loans granted at below market rates in order to give those who  work with their hands and actually produce the leeway they need to  survive. While smaller farmers who incorrectly followed the example of  the liberal marketeers and engaged in classes of production dependent on  large mass markets, such as dairy and soy farming, will receive special  incentives to diversify away from said practices. That said the  accompanying margin-protection insurance programs that went along with  such practices        will also be dismantled.   In order to guarantee strict  oversight of these agencies and further the goal of restoring our society to its former strength a dramatic transformation of the form and  usage of national government will be required. Parts of what are now  federal departments will be eliminated while their remainders in some  cases will have to be conglomerated to facilitate a better co-ordination  of the processes necessary to see this great goal through. For example,  the creation of a Department for Housing and Re-ruralization comprised  of element from the former departments of agriculture, housing and urban  development and education as well as the EPA.     \n\nTo accomplish this  we will need the work of a strong unflinching government, perhaps much  mightier than anything our current system is capable of producing. Our  federalist government with its constant alterations of rule by misguided  and selfish cliques could likely never accomplish a social  transformation as grand as the one discussed here. Both its inability to  develop and implement long range plans and in many respects its  beholdeness to international business interests suggest a change in the  structure and makeup of our government will be required to see these  changes set in motion. What we need is a form of government free of the  corrosive social inclinations that accompanied the 'modernization' and  mechanization of society.\n\nIn short what we need is a monarchy; a  government unafraid to take the reins and guide society in a direction  all too often ignored and looked down upon by those who have told us  they have all the answers. These people have failed to secure the true  well being of our people in many ways. Whether in terms of employment,  where just as with the introduction of mechanization we are suffering  from mass joblessness (at about 28% according to the government's own  figures), or as regards our health, bombarded as we are with the harmful  chemical cocktails that swirl about us both in our rural and non-rural  settings.\n\nEscaping from the toxic mileau manipulated into existence  over the past few centuries will be a daunting long term process. It  will take generations to complete and entail in many ways a complete  reconsideration of how our society is organized and run. The challenge  is great but even greater is the will to see the wrongs of the past  undone, This is a struggle in which we can not fail. And indeed once we  marshal all the resources of society to our side there can be no doubt  that we will together restore society to its true equilibrium, where man  is again free from the toils and corruptions of modernism just as God  intended."

Hi all,\n\nI've struggled with confidence and anxiety for quite a while and I have found the transition to Uni to be somewhat difficult, although I've found my housemates in 3rd year to be really supportive and in particular my housemate Sophie.  \n\n\nWith climate change being front page news, with many local governments declaring a climate emergency, I decided that I wanted to do something to help raise awareness whilst also going out of my comfort zone and challenging myself. I managed to find out about the World Naked Bike Ride - a fantastic peaceful protest ride in towns and cities across the UK to raise awareness for the vulnerability of cyclists and remove dependence on fossil fuels.  \n\n\nAfter some research I decided to take the plunge and take part in the London ride last summer. After chatting about it with Sophie she decided that she would also be keen to take part as a keen environmentalist and also to provide me with some support. The ride is classified 'as bare as you dare' so we both agreed that we wouldn't go the full hog but we would ride in our underwear.  \n\n\nWe got an early train up to London with our bikes and made our way to sunny Hyde Park and joined everyone else for the start of the ride. We both got ready in Hyde Park where I stripped down to just my boxers whilst Sophie stripped down to just a pair of knickers.  \n\n\nThe ride was absolutely amazing with so many people being so supportive with a common core value of helping to protect the environment, and the ride helped me so much with my confidence and anxiety issues - I'm so grateful to have Sophie as a friend and I would urge anyone who is struggling with anxiety to look to their circle of friends for support! University can be difficult but there are always people who are willing to listen. \n\nShe's cool with me posting an action shot from the ride:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1klm441qdd41.jpg?width=1870&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06889482af35ce0b302e91af9d5849d4c4fa558f"

I’m a big advocate for sustainability, and I love to reduce waste and be green whenever I possibly can.\n\nI’m involved in my university’s environmental club as the communications manager, and the student government association as the sustainability committee chair. I know our university is a bit... lacking... in sustainability, to say the least. Unfortunately, the bigwigs who make the decisions at our university do not care about sustainability at all. We do have some things, like compostable straws made from plants and paper food containers, but we don’t have much.\n\nHowever, I’d like to change this! I’ve been communicating with many people at my university about making potential changes, but I thought I would come here as well!\nWhat are some changes that a university could, and would be willing to make?\nI don’t want to propose anything too drastic (like solar panels on EVERY bulding), but I do want to bring it to the university’s attention that the student body does care about our environmental impact, and that we want to make a change.\n\nThank you so much for any and all advice! I’d really like to make a difference within my community, even if it’s something small to start. Our school color is green after all, so I think we should make an effort to BE green! :)\n\nTL/DR: What are some ways I can help my university be more sustainable/green?"

ey4ne0,"Jordan Peterson on Climate Change. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBbvehbomrY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBbvehbomrY) \n\nPeterson is wrong on this, first because he doesn't acknowledge that our relationship to science is mistaken and abusive, and second because he doesn't appreciate that morality is an ingrained sense, fostered in human beings by evolution in a tribal social context over millions of years.   \n\nPeterson describes, what I would call the ideological architecture of society - as logos, but by far the best candidate for logos; (in effect the word of a Creator God) is scientific truth. It's not the social contracts and moral codes homo sapiens invented in the course of evolutionary history,  as expressions of that ingrained moral sense, but ascribed to God - in order to forge an objective authority to facilitate a transition from a tribal way of life, to multi-tribal social organisation. It's the valid knowledge of reality/Creation, uncovered by science.   \n\nThe problem stems from the Church's reaction to Galileo's proof of Copernicus claims that the earth orbits the sun, set out in 'Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems' not published in 1633. Instead of publishing the work, the Church banned Galileo's writings, found Galileo grievously suspect of heresy, and held him under house arrest for the rest of his life. The chilling effect upon subsequent philosophy was profound, even while Galileo's punishment was relatively humane for an organisation that burned witches at the stake right through to 1792.   \n\nIf instead, the Church had welcomed Galileo as discovering the means to decode the word of God made manifest in Creation, and so accorded science the authority it rightfully owns, we would not now be facing an existential threat from climate change. Science would have been pursued and integrated morally into politics and economics over the past 400 years, instead of being decried as heresy, while being used to drive the industrial revolution from around 1730.  Free to apply technology without regard to science as a description of reality, but instead, solely concerned with the power and profit of ideological institutions, the wrong technologies have been applied. \n\nThe most obvious example of this is nuclear weapons. Over 70,000 nuclear weapons were created at the height of the Cold War, because the USSR and the US had different ideas on political economy. The USSR failed hard. I don't disagree with Pterson on that - but in this he is wrong. From a scientific understanding of reality, there's an order in which technology should be applied, that begins with renewable energy, hydrogen fuel, desalination and irrigation - that together with aqua-culture (fish farming), recycling and conservation, can support a large human population - at high levels of welfare, sustainably.   \n\nWind and solar are also misapplications of technology - an improvement on our addiction to the profits from fossil fuels, but by far the largest source of renewable energy available is the big ball of molten rock beneath our feet, and the second is the ceaseless motion of the waves. Tap into either, or both of these, and we can have virtually limitless energy available, to produce water, fuel, and food, to distribute goods, and push back against desertifcation by bringing more land into productive use.   \n\nThe only question is, if we have the sophistication to recognise science is a highly valid and coherent understanding of reality - far more worthy of our observance than the ignorance of our long dead ancestors, while at the same time - respecting those traditional ideas, and the social structures built upon them as we struggle for survival.   \n\nIn my view, this can be achieved, not least by the EU. A regional acceptance of the authority of a scientific understanding of reality maintains national and religious identity, while allowing for a science based industrial strategy - that ideally, would develop, apply and sell the technologies necessary to sustainability outlined above, all around the world. It can be done. Whether it will, is another question entirely."

f7b9vl,"What is unfair balance? You already know that social entrepreneurs are often called Changemakers - creators of change and revolutionists. However, in order to achieve large or small changes, it is not necessary to always call for radical measures. You need to have an excellent sense of balance and understand the laws of social system’s development. Why do some problems can be solved quickly while others stay unresolved for decades? That's what I want to start talking about.\n\nNobel laureate Mohammed Yunus described a clear order of action that should be followed by a social entrepreneur:\n\n1. Find a stable but unfair balance.\n\n2. Find a solution that will make a difference.\n\n3. Set a new fair balance.\n\nWhat balances are we talking about? An unfair balance means discrimination against a group that lacks the resources and influences to make a difference. Harassment or problem exists for a long time and in this sense it is stable. Society may not know about the problem, or may consider harassment normal (for example decriminalization of LGBT's in some countries). In any case, the problem is reproduced and not solved.\n\nThe task of a social entrepreneur is to find a solution that can change the existing order of things. It requires offering a new approach to the problem, testing the solution, making sure it works and then scaling the results.\n\nThe results need to be perceived as a new norm, a self-evident value, as a fair balance. When it comes to everyday practices and rituals, the majority of people need to treat minorities in a different, non-discriminating way. \n\nTo put it bluntly, social entrepreneurs eliminate familiar practices which at the same time are not fair. When something becomes familiar, we start to consider it normal. We are used to plastic pollution, climate change, nightmare news in press, growing gap between rich and poor. We get along with it, although we understand that it's not right at all. This is an unfair balance. The situation is not pleasant, but people reproduce it and don't try to change. In words they may resent, complain, demand, but they don’t take actions in order to change something. Let us look at the example of education. I will talk about my country – Russia, as I know its situation best. \n\nCurrent model of russian education kills creativity in children. Schoolchildren are focused on tests, exams which don’t prepare them for a real life in today's complex world. Bans, discipline, tests, unification of everything. The system is too complicated and archaic. The Ministry of Education is making plans, management is rushing to meet indicators, teachers are swamped with paperwork. Meanwhile, parents earn money for children's education, and children pretend to learn. Such a huge simulation by so many people gives the impression that everything is working. This is an unfair balance.\n\nTo change the situation, you need to understand that it has developed and is being reproduced due to the behavior of all parties involved. After all, it benefits everyone. The Ministry of Education reports, teachers are paid, parents fulfill their duty to children, and children are free so they can concentrate on other activities. You don't have to try too hard, think and look for alternatives. Somehow everything is working. Poorly but it is.  \n\nMost of us are not revolutionaries. We play by the established rules, seek to successfully master them and move somewhere. This is the power of social inertia, fed by the silence consent of the majority.\n\nWhat is the first natural desire? Burn everything to hell, and build a new model of education. Students could be home schooled or attend online courses. The impulse is clear, but the solution is bad because it touches only the surface not the core of the problem.\n\nA true social entrepreneur, must immerse himself in a problem, keep emotions under control and understand the principles which keep the balance stable. If you simply consider your opponents to be obscurants and abyss, you deprive yourself of a huge amount of very important information. Complex systems are always contradictory, so it is so important to dig to the essence of the opposite point of view. Only by understanding someone else's logic you will be able to see effective ways to change it.\n\nSimply negating an unfair balance, often brings in a reverse effect. Those who already are in the system will maintain their status quo as a response to the attacks from the outside. Don't forget, for them it is a natural order, a norm, and your attacks look like provocation or foolishness. But you need these people, because only they have the knowledge which is necessary to understand the essence of equilibrium. The more you communicate with representatives of the system as partners, the better you will understand the causes of the current balance and the conditions that keep it stable.\n\nI often say that a social entrepreneur should first “fall in love” with the problem, or at least respect those with whom he strongly disagrees. It is a hard mindset to achieve, but without due respect you will not take their arguments seriously, your analysis will be weak and the proposed solution will not be optimal. Take the position not of an expert, but of a student, with an unbiased view of the world, who wants to understand the topic. Deep dive into a context will make it possible to see the foundations of the unfair balance.\n\nWhen you understand the true reasons, you will be able to concentrate all your resources for an accurate strike on them to disrupt the balance and lean the scales to your side. We will talk about it later. And welcome to our community of social entrepreneurs and impact investors Galileo - [www.iiic.ch](https://www.iiic.ch)"

Depending on my mood can sway my decision.\n\nWhat information about a product that a brand provides really gives you that feeling of trust, that their claims are true emotionally vs logically?"

Worked on an organic zero-waste farm, a local rainforest and indigenous peoples(South American dominant) protection non-profit, and as a field technician/GIS intern. All offered great experience and helped me shape what aspect of sustainability I want to focus on. Since graduating I have become very interested in the business side of sustainability and how the action of businesses can help reshape our social fabric and guide our policies. I am now working at a grocery store and taking community college courses related to logistics management. These courses are just to see if I am actually interested in the topic/study of logistics. Dip me toes in the waters of SCM. I really appreciate the potential control logistics/SCM allows for. Especially with procurement and all the transportation considerations needed. I am also interested in programming and agribusiness.  \nI can now study/work more easily outside of the US since I recently got my citizenship. So now I am looking into masters programs and jobs anywhere and everywhere. Ultimately I would like to be working with businesses to reduce waste and reaccess how we look at consumers and marketing as a whole. We produce so much crap as it is and I don't want to add to it by trying to make some new fantastic replacement products. We don't have to reinvent the wheel... But I am going on too long with this post.  \nEssentially my focus leans towards sustainability above all, as well as interests in business (management and logistics perspective), horticulture, and enabling developing nations to make sustainability a priority in their future development. Do y'all have any advice on universities with good programs or countries/states that are keen on sustainable development? I have been looking into a lot of programs in Canada, Colorado, numerous European countries, and even places in India. I am also looking close by in my state (Texas). There is a lot to look at and choose from, but some experienced insight or any advice y'all may have would be much appreciated.   \nThanks in advance..."

He was one of the first scientists to quantify the extent to which human actions are responsible for global warming.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;As a lead author on the 3rd Assessment by the International Panel on Climate Change in 2001, he concluded that ‘most of the observed global warming was due to human influence’. More recently, (having established that calculating a safe concentration of greenhouse gases was very difficult indeed), he worked out instead how many tonnes of carbon would be acceptable, a shift in emphasis that paved the way for the current Net Zero carbon emissions policy.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Myles tells Jim Al-Khalili how our ability to predict climate change has evolved from the early days when scientists had to rely on the combined computing power of hundreds of thousands of personal computers. He sheds light on how the IPCC works and explains why, he believes, fossil fuel industries must be forced to take back the carbon dioxide that they emit.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If carbon capture and storage technologies makes their products more expensive, so be it."

fbicn5,"Project Envi - A social mapping system to encourage sustainability  \n\nFor about a year now I have been sitting on a project that I feel would make a difference if it were made and it has been constantly tormenting me that I have lacked the motivation to push it forward in any meaningful way. After some introspection, I have concluded that the #1 reason why I haven't moved forward with the idea is that I have been too paranoid to actually give away any information on my idea. Well that ends today, here is my project.\n\n( note before you read : this is a design concept, there is no prototype yet because I do not have a background in programming, I will explain that more at the end)\n\nEnvi is the codename for the social mapping concept that I came up for a graphic design class. To put it simply, it is a map where users can add ""pins"" for others in their community to see. Green pins are sustainable businesses, social services, environmental spots, etc. Blue pins can be pretty much any event in your community. Red pins are threats to the environment or threats to your community like MTBE groundwater contamination sites, factories dumping waste into rivers, or even things as small as trash on the side of the highway.\n\nAs these pins are created by users, it gives the event / problems in your community more attention. For example, there is a trailer park with contaminated groundwater from MTBE leaked in the 80's in a town near me. The cancer rates in the park are insanely high. One day I came across a man who lived there and was advocating about how he was going to bring it up to the state capitol … and then he mentioned how I also live near another leak site. If I never ran into that man, I would have never known about either of these contaminated sites. With Envi those MTBE sites would be big red marks for everyone in the surrounding areas to see, and all of those eyes will turn to the people trying to brush the issue under the rug to save a buck. Likewise, rallies and protests will also gain more exposure if the events are on the map ahead of time, leading to a greater turnout.\n\nAs an app, Envi will have two parts. The first part will be the map and the second part will be a social media platform much like any other, with one big difference. Unlike most big social media platforms, Envi will encourage users to participate in civil discussion with people they disagree with, rather than resorting to divisive behaviors like name calling and yelling matches. I know it is impossible to actually eliminate divisiveness and intolerance from a platform, but I believe there are plenty of people ready to move away from fb and other platforms that don't even really attempt to discourage division because it's profitable to them.\n\nThere are two goals of Envi, and I believe both will help the environment. The first goal is exposing the good and bad sustainability practices in a city through the social mapping system. The more people see, the more people will care. The second goal is to bring communities together through the advertisement and creation of events. I believe that a large reason why we are so divided and hateful today is because we live increasingly sheltered lives. The more we go out in our communities, the more we see the people who live around us, as well as the diverse opinions these people hold. As we see people who share differing opinions, and talk to them in a civilized manner, we realize that not all of our differences are bad. Heck you might even convince a climate change denier that the environment is in danger. I believe that as we overcome hatred and division, the health of the planet we live on becomes less of a partisan issue.\n\nNow then, as I mentioned at the top of this post I have no programming knowledge to actually create the app. The biggest hurdle I was facing was overcoming my fear of publicizing my ideas literally anywhere. Now that hurdle is being jumped, the next big hurdle to overcome will be creating a team with a programmer and forming a community to help support the project. In the end I do not want this project to be ""my"" project, much like the pins I want Envi itself to be community driven. That being said, I have created a subreddit and discord for anybody to join and give their ideas on how to make the application as appealing and successful as possible so it makes a good impact.\n\n[https://discord.gg/JPcgqwQ](https://discord.gg/JPcgqwQ)\n\n[r/projectenvi](https://www.reddit.com/r/projectenvi/) (not r/ envi)\n\nThank you for reading! I appreciate any feedback, reactions or criticism to my project."

fc9bqx,"Live Civix Launch - Spreading the word and looking to recruit help Hi guys, my name is Phil. My co-founder Porshea and I have been working on an idea for a new organization and website called LiveCivix. \n\nThe concept is, people need to start taking ownership of the problems in the world and working those problems and implementing solutions. \n\nWe see a disconnect between people that want to take action, a place to organize, a knowledge base on what to do, and finally projects that exist or can be created to make a difference. \n\nAs an example, the book Drawdown gives about 100 categories of solutions that can be implemented to tackle climate change, but many people haven't heard of the book. \n\nOr there are brilliant people with exsting projects that need to be supported and implemented on a mass scale like Brian von Herzen and his seaweed farm project that has the potential to be a game changer in the climate campaign. His project isn't widely known. And there will be many more researchers and specialized people that have next generation projects that needs a home. \n\nWe launched our website today based on the software from phpfox, and we are looking for people that are interested in making a difference and putting our ideas to work. We've spend months developing the concept, and years thinking about the concept we will include in Live Civix. If you are interested or known someone that is, you can check out the website at ([www.livecivix.com](https://www.livecivix.com) \- \*there will be a few bugs as we just launched. Or join us at [www.reddit.com/r/livecivix](https://www.reddit.com/r/livecivix) or message me directly whether you are just curious, want to be part of the solution, or can potentially offer us some more indepth help. \n\nEither way, we believe that a new way of doing things is required and we need regular people from all over to step up and help to tackle the problems of today that will hurt us tomorrow. \n\nThank you for your time!\n\nPhil"

fljw68,"Plastics, Fossil Fuels, and Fast Fashion are damaging our environment...But there is one super plant that could have the solution... &amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are all becoming much more aware of our impacts on the environment, and there is a lot of talk about how to cut down plastic use, slow down fast fashion, and alternative fuels for cars. Well, i'm here to let you know that there is one plant that could be the answer to all of these problems, and more! \n\n**That plant is hemp.** \n\nHemp is being dubbed by many as a ""super plant"", and ""the most sustainable fibre on the planet"", and we sure think this could be \n\nWith our recent launch of hemp shirts on Kickstarter, we have been so impressed with people sharing our enthusiasm for hemp, that we wanted to write a blog around the other uses of hemp, to show you just how versatile and wonderful it really is. \n\n“Hemp. Aka the most versatile plant on the planet. Hemp is the only plant that can [feed you](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/add-hemp-seeds-to-every-meal-for-protein-nutritional-benefits), clothe you, create a home for you, and provide you with [natural beauty products](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/science-backed-benefits-of-hemp).”Source: MindBodyGreen.org \n\nSo you already know that hemp can be used to make t-shirts, but It has hundreds of other uses and we will cover off a few of the main ones today. But first, I want to tell you what it can't be used for...\n\nTo get high.\n\nThat's right, despite the stigma around Hemp. It's a different type of the cannabis plant to the one used to make marijuana. There's next to no THC (the active ingredient in marijuana) in the Hemp plant therefore it cannot be used for this purpose. \n\nHemp cultivation is becoming more widespread, and as more hemp is grown, it is becoming a highly regarded resource to help make the world a more sustainable and eco friendly place.  Hemp is super multifunctional and has proved itself one of the most versatile natural fibres out there. Here's a list of current and up and coming uses for the super plant: \n\n“Hemp has been cultivated on planet earth for over 10,000 years. It has been an important source of food and fibre with references dating back to ancient China and Mesopotamia. Applications of hemp plants evolved from simple rope and coarse woven fabric to paper and sail cloth.” Source : HempTrade.ca \n\nDid you know? As a farmer in parts of the USA in the 1600s, it was actually mandatory to grow Hemp on a percentage of your land. Each farmer had to dedicate land specifically to Hemp because it was so widely used. This sadly changed when the government ruled it an illegal plant due to its association with the cannabis plant. \n\n**Hemp oil** \- Hemp oil has many uses and benefits, people swear by it. In fact, it has started to become so popular in Australia, there have been cases of it selling out and being hard to get hold of. Hemp oil contains Omega 3 and Omega 6 which are said to help inflammation, so many people with arthritis are using it.  \n\n**Hemp moisturiser** and skin care - Hemp is used in face moisturisers, and even to help with the aging process, and help treat acne. \n\n**Nutrition** \- Hemp seeds are becoming routine in the diets of many health conscious people. Why? It is great protein (popular in vegans and vegetarians), it also contains Omega 3 and 6 fatty oils, Omega 9, Minerals (Calcium, Iron, Magnesium), and Vitamins.\n\n**Food** \- Not only can you get hemp seeds, and hearts, but people are starting to experiment with hemp in food more, such as Hemp burgers! \n\n**Hemp milk** \- Yup. There’s a new contender for non dairy milk. Hemp milk is pretty darn good for you too. It is lactose, soy, and gluten free and high in fatty acids and proteins. It is very nutritious, and people have even started making it themselves at home. \n\n**Hempcrete** \- Hemp has been used as a replacement for concrete for many years as I found out last year, and is now becoming increasingly in demand. \n\nI’m certainly no expert in hempcrete, concrete or any other elements of construction, so here's a bit on hempcrete from a far more knowledgeable source:\n\n“It has **great** energy efficiency. It maintains a steady temperature. It doesn't shrink, so there are no crack lines. It is a breathable material.”  Source: Houseplanninghelp.com \n\n**Rope** \- One of the oldest uses for hemp, possibly the original.  Hemp has been used in rope in all kinds of trades, but is famous for its uses in shipping. \n\n“In 1997, a **hemp rope dating back** to 26900 BC was found in Czechoslovakia, making it the oldest known object to be associated with cannabis.” Source: Ancient Origins \n\n**Soap** \- Hemp is known to be gentle on sensitive skin, as well as being moisturising, so it makes the perfect ingredient for natural soap. \n\n**Fuel** \- Hemp biofuel is being discussed as a possibility. As we are becoming more conscious and trying to remove the use of fossil fuels, scientists are looking for a way to make an environmentally and sustainable fuel, and hemp is being talked about a lot right now, so watch this space! \n\n**Sunscreen** \- With it’s natural UV protection properties, and it's moisturising feeling, it has started to be used in making sunscreen, and with much less harmful ingredients, compared with some other options on the market. \n\n**Beer** \- Heck yes. Hemp beer is on the market. Gluten free, vegan friendly beer with hemp in it. Because, why not?! \n\n**Pet food** \- Because we can’t keep this hemp goodness all to ourselves - It’s great for our pets too! There is currently cat and dog food enriched with hemp oil, and some brands have been recommended by vets. \n\n**Pet bedding -** A safe, natural option for pet bedding, which offers comfort as well as antimicrobial properties. \n\n**Paper** \- Hemp paper has been around for years - in fact it can be traced back to around 200 BC in China. \n\n***Interesting Fact:***\n\nThe first draft of the declaration of independence was written on hemp paper.\n\n**Protein powder** \-  I must admit, nutrition definitely isn't one of my expertise so I looked over a few websites to learn a bit more about this. Turns out hemp protein powder is meant to be pretty good. \n\n**“Hemp protein powder** is a high-quality plant-based protein that contains 20 amino acids — the building blocks of protein. Protein is crucial for developing, growing and maintaining muscles, tissues and vital organs. It also helps boost metabolism and increases fat-burning.” Yoursuper.com \n\n**Nappies/diapers** \- Hemp nappies for babies are becoming a big thing. The main reasons hemp is so good for diapers are; It is environmentally friendly (we already know this), it’s baby friendly - the fabric is tested and certified to be safe to use on young babies and children, it’s durable, it’s soft, it’s stretchy, and it’s absorbent. \n\n**To clean soil -** I talked about this in a post recently, but it's a valid one for this list, and I love talking about it, because I just think it’s so wonderful. Hemp produces high quantities of biomass, which returns to the soil and decomposes, giving nutrients back into the soil.  Not only that but it also is also able to absorb heavy metals and pollutants (Phytovolatilization).  An example of this is:\n\nHemp was used to help clean up after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in  Ukraine in 1986, due to its ability to absorb radioactive toxins from the ground.\n\n**Shoes -** This is quite a new thing as far as I can tell, but i’ve seen a couple of brands of sneakers coming out with hemp trainers, as a vegan, and sustainable option. I'm excited for this idea though, and can't wait to get a pair myself. \n\n**Plastic -** This is beginning to be talked about. The idea of plastic being replaced with ‘bioplastics’, including hemp as one of the runners. I really believe this is just the beginning for hemp, it’s a fibre that has a highly growing market, and now you know why. You’ll be hearing about hemp a lot more in future.  Hopefully it really can help to turn this environmental crisis around, because its negative impacts are generally much less than current material we are overusing. \n\nPretty impressive hey? If you know of any other uses for this magnificent plant, please comment below, I'd love to hear of any others you may have. \n\n**Cars** \- Believe it or not, this is actually a piece of history, which may well make a comeback. Henry Ford made a prototype hemp car back in 1941, which was also designed to run on hemp fuel. If you read up, it seems that it may also become a thing of the future... I think Mr Ford was definitely well ahead of his time there, and onto something. Time will tell. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have just made my own brand of hemp shirts, which I am currently crowdfunding to help get off the ground.  They are available now on Kickstarter, check out the link to snap one up at our Kickstarter prices (only a few left at the $20USD price tag ) Follow this link to grab one before they go full price!

Costs are subsidized and standard of living can increase without more expenses. The ideas aren't revolutionary, and the creation of an intentional community has been done many times before ... I just want to try making one myself. \n\nI have a background in construction and a good sense of what's possible with easily accessible construction materials.

fphrp5,"I want feedback on my sustainability extension! Last week I posted here about a [mailing list for ethical brands](https://gethonest.co). There are WAY more awesome companies than I could ever feature in an email list, so I decided to build a chrome extension to feature these brands in new tabs (in a beautiful, non-intrusive way)!\n\nI’m experimenting with 2 new ideas and want your feedback on which one would be more useful.\n\n1. During an amazon checkout, prompt ethical alternatives. For example, if you're shopping for a Calvin Klein T-shirt, suggest a similar Pact shirt instead (wearpact.com).\n2. A credit system for ethical stores.  Every day you have the extension installed, you gain credits, which can be spent at ethical retailers. This one is a bit more complicated, since it requires a payment system and probably partnering with certain retailers, but I think it’s definitely possible!\n\nSo what do you think? Do either of these features sound useful? Which one should I spend time on?\n\nYou can download the extension here (just launched it yesterday): [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/honest/penabcampeckofjaopgibdjoickapnoj](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/honest/penabcampeckofjaopgibdjoickapnoj)"

fq70ry,"I’m building the sustainable death care solution that turns your body into a tree when you die, and puts that tree in a memorial forest. Help me make this a movement. Hey folks, I want you to imagine something for a sec: what if instead of mourning our loved ones in graveyards dedicated to death, we celebrated them in forests dedicated to life?\nI'm trying to make this vision a reality by building reLive, the sustainable death care solution that turns your body into a memorial tree when you die (by mixing CO2-neutrally cremated ashes with seeds and soil), and lays that tree to rest into a 'memorial forest' space – the graveyard of the 21st century. It's the first full-cycle ashes-to-tree concept. \nI have a lot of visions for what this memorial forest space would be like – it would be a beautiful, tranquil place you want to stay awhile. It would be a place for reflecting on the past and reconnecting with the present and with nature. There would be regular events to keep the space alive.\nI am even imagining planting QR codes at the base of each memorial tree – when you scan them, these codes would pull up a live forum where friends and relatives of that person can post memories and photos, giving you an insight into who they were. It's the best way for someone coming to the end of their life to complete the circle of life and leave a sustainable legacy, and its a new way for all of us who remain to stay connected to those we have lost.\nIf you think this is a great concept, please join the movement. All you have to do is sign this petition (and share!): https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/relive-the-sustainable-death-care-solution\nThe more signatures I have, the more I can demonstrate people are interested in this, and the more likely I am to find an investor who will help me bring this concept to life.\n\n(And if you still have questions on what this is all about/how we're different from other companies who are centered around this concept, please check us out: www.relive.global)\n\nHope you are all staying happy, healthy and connected to nature during this difficult time!"

Now, because of circumstances, we're quite free to pursue this idea. \n\nThe project:\n\nThe Ecovillage movement is nothing new but efforts towards sustainable living en masse seem to be quite disjointed and independent one from the other. We want to aid the acceleration of this standard of living by creating a ""Plug and Play"" sort of model for empowerment of individuals that are struggling under the current system (i.e. disenfranchised minorities, neglected rural communities, the troubled youth). This model would consist of a hyperledger that functions as both a library of resources for housing, plant growth, self-governance, and a means of establishing a living network of interconnectivity that allows members to be recognized and validated globally by the net.\n\nRight now we are creating the initial documentation and planification for a practical pilot project, and we invite anybody who's interested in this kind of endeavour to approach us; whether to collaborate, or just talk about the idea. We have plenty of resources on the matter that we would love to share and expand on. \n\nFeel free to contact me!\n\nCheers!"

See also its [10-page synopsis](https://www.withouthotair.com/synopsis10.pdf).\n\nI think this book is very relevant to sustainability, because it informs on energy and energy policy, and that's much needed.\n\n**Some takeaways:**\n\n1. Showing the significant place of energy in our lives, and **why an energy transition is needed**\n2. Getting a **precise, quantitative picture of the energy footprint** of Western countries and individuals\n3. Dispelling various **""mythconceptions""** about the energy sector\n   1. In particular, it's not as simple as ""let's just move to solar / wind"" - there are situation-specific constraints, drawbacks and challenges to consider\n   2. I wish such knowledge was more widespread - even fervent ecologists often have a completely inaccurate inaccurate understanding of these problems, resulting in misguided proposals and efforts.\n4. Examining various **solutions** for the energy transition\n\nAlthough the book is 11 years old, most of the material is still valid - the technology has evolved a bit, but the physics haven't.\n\nThe book is quite accessible, and MacKay's writing style is lovely. There are technical annexes for those who want to take a deeper scientific dive on these topics."

(Industry, politics, socio-economics) Today you are increasingly seeing more industries and companies evolve with corporate social responsibility, sustainability reports and Eco-friendly operations, products and certifications. Sprouting in early 2000's, we began to see some massive changes all across the board in the name of sustainable action and with that a ton of jobs.  (Environmental consultants, EHS: Environmental health and safety, environmental remediation, corporate stewardship)\n\nI've started making a list of sustainability trends that I believe might help myself and others understand sustainability better or even get a jump start on a impactful career path in sustainability. \n\n\-DATA - no matter the industry, logistics and analytics are have quickly become an essential asset and with that a worthy career field. Sustainable objectives are difficult because they require so much data to ensure things are on track. That also means social media data- makes sense why they give you access for""free""!\n\n\-Agriculture- The current global system of agriculture is relatively poor. The whole life cycle of  food system creates an incredibly large amount of precious wasted food. Small companies like Choco are stepping in and making the food system more sustainable by connecting local chefs with local farmers. \n\n\- Green washing- From lawn care to house-hold products, everyone is putting 'green' in their company name or products- be weary. Google your products along with ""SDS safety data sheet"" or ""EPD Environmental product declaration"" or anything of the likes and see what chemicals are safe **parents**. The United States SEC (securities and exchange commission) is good at stopping this, but other countries are just beginning to catch on.\n\n\- Growing demand of Electric vehicles in China is a huge economic sign. Currently is causing   industries such as the battery and paint coatings industries to innovate accordingly. \n\n\- US politicians are finally getting involved with climate change and you should too! Start with supporting with what you spend.\n\n\-Social programs are becoming huge vehicles for the philanthropy and image of a company. Try to get involved in these areas by careers such as program planning. But be weary, some of the worst companies throw the best parties."

Most of the three hundred or so global ""initiatives"" do little of importance for actual sustainable development. \n\nI believe that ultimately, the responsibility lies with the people and an incorporated model of sustainable development with foundation owned commercial interests.

I have been working on an ongoing project for fouryears now nick-named [“[Signs of collapse]”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.\n\nI try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.\n\nI define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.\n\nI’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.\n\nFeel free to share any of the material or repost this on other suitable subreddits.

fuaa3z,"College Note Taking One of my new year's resolutions in 2020 to become zero waste. And I've learned that it's really damn hard. Things like a reusable coffee cup and water bottle are easy but sometimes garbage is just unavoidable (especially now that my family is sheltered and we had to pick up food that will last and many restaurants stop taking reusable containers to protect their workers). But then I wondered about note taking. You don't use paper if you take notes on an iPad instead but then that's more electricity that you have to use to charge it (the environmental impact of electricity differs by state but all 50 should be making a push to make it more wind powered in my opinion). Paper can be recycled but there's no guarantee that, even with zero recyling contamination, something you recycle will make it into actual recycling. Is there a significantly better method of note taking or are they about equal?"

fxwa4z,"Guide to Greenwashing Your Sustainability Report (satire) **A simple template on how to BS a sustainability report with minimal effort.**\n\nI’ve read a hundred sustainability reports so you don’t have to.\n\nNew to this? Perfect. This is a guide for someone with no experience, and preferably no conscience either. By the end you will have a perfectly neutral Sustainability Report that nobody, including the CEO, will read.\n\n**Cover.**\n\nPut most of your effort into the first impression. The first page shows up as a thumbnail in emails and is the only page anyone will really see.\n\nMain photo: Gather together all the women and people of colour at your company into a group photo. It will be awkward *before* and *after* the photo but you’ll still get smiles for *the fraction of a second needed*. If this simply isn’t feasible you can always use a stock photo of a windmill, solar panel, or plant-inside a lightbulb.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/idarie28rtr41.jpg?width=612&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5428ced1607391d8a7ff1364a9e6d693a96dca60\n\n**Page 2.**\n\nYou must do this: you must put a cutout of your CEO in front of a calming background. They probably didn’t write much so be sure to format text into three columns and do the text wraparound thing when it comes to the signature and cutout. If they or their ghost-writer has writer’s block, suggest themes like “trust” and “transparency”. They will love it and you’ll be able to recycle these vague themes throughout.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/04efxm59rtr41.png?width=618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1668f9e0b55eabac90529d2620667054cb9afc3\n\n**Page 3.**\n\nHere is where you *could* put current and historical CO2e data but won’t. Someone, probably ten years ago did a quick assessment and realized that your company is objectively ruining the planet. Instead you want one or two inconsequential anecdotes from the past year. If your company is in a location with a clean electric grid: mention it but exclude any context — make it seem like your company bought renewable energy.\n\nScour the internet for one of the *hundred-or-so rating companies* until you find one that gave you an “A” or three “green leafs” or whatever. DON’T hyperlink to them. It may reveal better ratings were possible. “AA”, “AAA” or five green leafs. You especially don’t want people knowing the rating was industry-specific.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pages 4–90.**\n\nYou might think 80+ pages is a lot for something that could be communicated in four but this is the point.\n\nA quantity over quality strategy will pay dividends (perhaps literally). You want people to open the PDF and give up. First you want to overwhelm your superiors, then the public. Your superiors will let it hang in their inbox for a few days while pretending to read it. Play along and only remind them when it’s too late.\n\nYou might be tempted to include a Table of Contents with hyperlinks. Don’t, this isn’t Wikipedia. Vagueness and disorientation is your key to success. You can spend at least four pages completely redefining what “sustainability” means to your specific company. Muddy the term as much as possible so that the reader just skips to the next part.\n\nReframe every economically smart environmental choice as if you’re a green pioneer. Did installing LED bulbs saving thousands of dollars? Mention the savings but frame it like you invented the bulbs. Did your company go paperless? Did your city mandate recycling? Reframe it as an initiative. There are plenty of progressive standards your company can take credit for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Final page / Appendix.**\n\nAbsolutely leave the most substantive info for last.\n\nDid some pesky nerd do an impact assessment? Don’t worry. Most people reading your magnum obscura never made it to the end. A hundred fonts and a thousand stock photo backgrounds ensured that you froze most mobile devices.\n\nDepending on local laws you can avoid specific definitions and GHG protocols. If so, avoid words like “direct” and “indirect”. Avoid things that have been standardized for decades. You can reinvent the wheel. Actually, make stabbing motions at anyone who suggests including “Scope 3 indirect CO2”. The higher-ups already think it makes your company look bad.\n\nIf you can’t exclude GHG emissions because your country mandates them you can: 1) Format the tables in such a way that it’s not easily copy-pasted. 2) Insert invisible characters. 3) If your corporate superiors have no conscience whatsoever, you might be able to create a small-font screenshot so that it’s both: hard to read and requires extra steps to make it searchable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Finishing notes:**\n\nDon’t have it audited, and if you do, don’t link to it. Finally, for the love of christ, bury it fourteen pages deep on your website.\n\nHappy greenwashing.\n\n\----\n\n*OP is the author.

The article that showed that is “Reducing food’s environmental impact through producers and consumers”, *Science, 360(6392), 987-992* ([https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987)). There is a summary [here](http://environmath.org/2018/06/17/paper-of-the-day-poore-nemecek-2018-reducing-foods-environmental-impacts/).\n\nThe 28% figure is in an erratum ([https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6429/eaaw9908](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6429/eaaw9908)), not in the original paper, because the authors had initially underestimated how much carbon could be sequestrated in soils and forests, if natural vegetation could grow back on land previously used for animal agriculture. They say ""In total, the 'no animal products' scenario delivers a 28% reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions acroess all sectors of the economy relative to 2010 emissions"".\n\nIt can also be deduced from the data available in the article:\n\n\-Food’s GHG emissions represent **26%** of global CO2eq emissions\n\n\-Adopting a plant-based diet would cut food’s GHG emissions by **49%**\n\n\-and free 3 billion hectares (&gt;Africa’s surface), where **8.1 billion metric tons** of CO2eq could be sequestrated per year (for 100 years) as natural vegetation re-establishes and soil carbon re-accumulates\n\n\-Global CO2eq emissions: **53 billion tons** of CO2eq ([https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions)). This one is not in the article but is the consensual figure as far as I could tell.\n\nSo 0.26\*0.49\*53 + 8.1 = 0.1274\*53 + 8.1 = 6.7522 + 8.1 = 14.8522\n\n14.99/53 = 28.02%"

g5vs0p,"Which is better for the environment: Baking bread at home or buying it at a cooperative? So I am going to be in walking distance from a cooperative in my area that has stuff in bulk, most stuff is local, and they have a bakery. I've been getting into making sourdough bread at home under the guise of sustainability. But if I really look at it, it doesn't exactly seem that environmentally friendly. \n\nFirst off, to bake sourdough the oven (\~15 yr old electric) needs to be at \~500 degrees F for about 2 hours (preheat dutch oven and baking two loaves separately). I do this about once a week. I also use half a five pound bag of bread flour (KAF) to make two loafs, but the oven time and temp is more of my concern. \n\nIn a bakery, they bake multiple loaves in their oven and their flour is most likely more locally sourced and in bulk. I could walk there and get a loaf in my own container (so no waste). So am I wrong for seeing it as a more environmentally friendly option than baking it at home or is this really trivial?"

g69e4p,"Case Studies is Companies Leveraging Sustainability as a Competitive Advantage Hi all,\n\nI'm working on a project with some fellow sustainability advocates which focuses around building a narrative for why companies should incorporate authentic sustainability into their strategies.  The benefits to the environment are clear.  Where we are starting to stall a little bit is in finding concrete examples of how businesses have benefited financially from sustainable investments.  Note: we do not think that finances are the most important aspect of a company's operations, but are being realistic that there people in corporate positions of power that disagree.  Therefore, we want concrete examples that show them that sustainability is not only about sacrificing profits to appease hippies.\n\nFor example, Tesla is the easy case study.  They drew a clear line in the sand that they would only build electric vehicles, then took that a step farther by incorporating solar energy and energy storage into their business model.  This has resulted in a ton of advantages ranging from brand prestige/equity to revenue from selling CO2/ZEV credits etc. etc.\n\nI'm asking for this community's help in discussing/sharing other examples of companies (or towns or countries or any other entity really) that have done the right thing from a sustainability perspective, then been rewarded by the market for it.\n\nLooking forward to hearing everyone's thoughts!  Thank you so much."

g7dyxt,"introducing project Ecopin : A concept for a green social media platform Ecopin is my concept for a social media platform that incorporates ""social mapping"" to strengthen communities and encourage environmental sustainability.  [The best description of the project is on my website here.](https://www.blbuckley.com/ecopin)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z77kjiqg0tu41.jpg?width=1275&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9bf5cfc88e48fa644be66462b4419d216e53c82\n\n*Before you read I want to state two things, first if you think you have seen a similar post before, you have. I posted the project a few months ago under the name ""invi"" in a few environmental subreddits. I gained a good amount of support from the posts and I am very grateful! The second thing I must state is that clearly I am not encouraging anybody to go out in their communities now, hopefully by the time this project is actually finished covid will no longer be such a massive threat to society.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo put it simply, ecopin  is a map where users can add ""pins"" for others in their community to see. Green pins are sustainable businesses, social services, environmental spots, etc. Blue pins can be pretty much any event in your community. Red pins are sites that are a threat to either the environment, the health of a community, or both.\n\nThe goal of social mapping as a social media platform is to bring attention to both the positive and negative things going around in a community. For example, in a neighboring town to mine, there is a trailer park where cancer rates are insanely high due to MTBE groundwater from an abandoned gas station from the 80's. One day I came across a man who lived there and was advocating about how he was going to bring it up to the state capitol … and then he mentioned how I also live near another MTBE leak site in my hometown. If I never ran into that man, I would have never known about either of these contaminated sites. With ecopin, those MTBE sites would be big red marks for everyone in the surrounding communities to see, and all of those eyes will turn to the big wigs trying to brush the issue under the rug.\n\nThere are two goals of ecopin, and I believe both will help the environment. The first goal is exposing the good and bad sustainability practices in a community through the social mapping system. The more people see, the more people will care. The second goal is to strengthen communities by encouraging user to participate and create local events. I believe that a large reason why we are so divided and hateful today is because we live increasingly sheltered lives. The more we go out in our communities, the more we see the people who live around us, as well as the diverse opinions these people hold. As we see people who share differing opinions, and talk to them in a civilized manner, we realize that not all of our differences are bad. Heck you might even convince a climate change denier that the environment is in danger. I believe that as we overcome hatred and division, the health of the planet we live on becomes less of a partisan issue.\n\n[Since a prototype hasn't been created, I cannot create a Kickstarter quite yet, instead I created a Patreon for the time being.](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=33155583&amp;fan_landing=true) I am also looking into messaging different environmental companies and organizations to see if I can receive their support as well, groups such as the Sierra Club and Project Sunrise are a few that come to mind. If you have any groups you think I should share the project with feel free to comment them!\n\nNow, where is ecopin now in terms of development? Personally, I am only a graphic artist, so sadly I cannot program this project, only design it and plot out how I want it to function. Since I first shared the project a few months ago, I was able to find a handful of programmers interested in the project. Last week we decided that open sourcing the project would be the best path forward, we haven't really  begun coding yet because we want to build our team some more so it is more organized. \n\n I am looking for anybody willing to donate their time to help with this project. I am not only looking for programmers, but also environmental activists, leaders, artists and designers who are passionate about sustainability and would want to be a part of this project. While I created the concept, I want the final product to be community driven. I have a Slack group created for the project, so if you have interest in helping feel free to message me and I will invite you!\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading, if you have any constructive feedback, criticism or recommendations for me feel free to comment!"

[The best description of the project is on my website here.](https://www.blbuckley.com/ecopin)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3y7smzln17v41.jpg?width=1275&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57cb6ecacd165b8141dfb84b080103a849603afe\n\n*Before you read I want to state two things, first if you think you have seen a similar post before, you have. I posted the project a few months ago under the name ""invi"" in a few environmental subreddits. I gained a good amount of support from the posts and I am very grateful! The second thing I must state is that clearly I am not encouraging anybody to go out in their communities now, hopefully by the time this project is actually finished covid will no longer be such a massive threat to society.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo put it simply, ecopin  is a map where users can add ""pins"" for others in their community to see. Green pins are sustainable businesses, social services, environmental spots, etc. Blue pins can be pretty much any event in your community. Red pins are sites that are a threat to either the environment, the health of a community, or both.\n\nThe goal of social mapping as a social media platform is to bring attention to both the positive and negative things going around in a community. For example, in a neighboring town to mine, there is a trailer park where cancer rates are insanely high due to MTBE groundwater from an abandoned gas station from the 80's. One day I came across a man who lived there and was advocating about how he was going to bring it up to the state capitol … and then he mentioned how I also live near another MTBE leak site in my hometown. If I never ran into that man, I would have never known about either of these contaminated sites. With ecopin, those MTBE sites would be big red marks for everyone in the surrounding communities to see, and all of those eyes will turn to the big wigs trying to brush the issue under the rug.\n\nThere are two goals of ecopin, and I believe both will help the environment. The first goal is exposing the good and bad sustainability practices in a community through the social mapping system. The more people see, the more people will care. The second goal is to strengthen communities by encouraging user to participate and create local events. I believe that a large reason why we are so divided and hateful today is because we live increasingly sheltered lives. The more we go out in our communities, the more we see the people who live around us, as well as the diverse opinions these people hold. As we see people who share differing opinions, and talk to them in a civilized manner, we realize that not all of our differences are bad. Heck you might even convince a climate change denier that the environment is in danger. I believe that as we overcome hatred and division, the health of the planet we live on becomes less of a partisan issue.\n\n[Since a prototype hasn't been created, I cannot create a Kickstarter quite yet, instead I created a Patreon for the time being.](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=33155583&amp;fan_landing=true) I am also looking into messaging different environmental companies and organizations to see if I can receive their support as well, groups such as the Sierra Club and Project Sunrise are a few that come to mind. If you have any groups you think I should share the project with feel free to comment them!\n\nNow, where is ecopin now in terms of development? Personally, I am only a graphic artist, so sadly I cannot program this project, only design it and plot out how I want it to function. Since I first shared the project a few months ago, I was able to find a handful of programmers interested in the project. Last week we decided that open sourcing the project would be the best path forward, we haven't really  begun coding yet because we want to build our team some more so it is more organized.\n\nI am looking for anybody willing to donate their time to help with this project. I am not only looking for programmers, but also environmental activists, leaders, artists and designers who are passionate about sustainability and would want to be a part of this project. While I created the concept, I want the final product to be community driven. I have a Slack group created for the project, so if you have interest in helping feel free to message me and I will invite you!\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading, if you have any constructive feedback, criticism or recommendations for me feel free to comment!"

But at the same time if you are that doctor, you help people on the daily for all of your career, and in the case of scientist, you could, for instance, help people for centuries by creating a medicine that cures some disease...whereas a self-sufficient individual on a country farm is alone, and only helps themself. \n\nIn essence, science or sustainability, because it’s hard to accomplish both in these times?"

The drive of extinction here is the availability of environment with right plants and free of pesticides, and not the reproduction rate.

I made a research recently which revealed that people are super motivated and willing to be more sustainable in life, even willing to pay more if it is better for the planet. Yet the reality is not like that. There is a big gap between say and do. The number one reason for not making eco-friendly buying decisions appears to be the cost of these products. Is it really expensive to be sustainable - when buying food for example-  or is it really about not knowing whether it worths the money, that it really has an impact?  What do you think?"

Our state have seen a huge influx of tourists in the last few years and has brought along with the economic benefits many problems related to rapid growth and improper planning. Having seen all the ill effects of such haphazard development, we in our village have decided to take a step back  and look at the long term effects of the decision we take today. We have educated all the villagers and formed a  committee to establish and promote sustainable tourism, a first in the region. Our main focus is on social equity, environment preservation and economic feasibility.\nSince this is a new and unknown field for us, we are looking for knowledge partners to guide and advice us in our journey. Please do recommend any institutions/individuals who might be able to help us. \nThanks."

ggx6ok,"Worried about my future I am an airplane pilot currently out of work due to tourism essentially being nonexistent at the moment for reasons I don't really need to explain. I am worried I won't find work at all this summer season, which is my primary income period, and therefore regress in skill and knowledge from not flying for a long time. I already haven't being flying since November 2019 because of winter (I live in Canada).\n\nHaving all this free time has allowed me to examine what is important to me, who I want to be, my personal morals, interests, etc.\n\nI love my work. I am primarily a float plane pilot. It is extremely fun, challenging, and rewarding work for me personally, but I do have problems with it...\n\nAirplane travel is not good for the planet. It uses incredible amounts of fuel and is one of the largest contributors to global emissions.\n\nI have been considering changing careers because I am having a hard time coming to terms with working in an unsustainable, polluting industry. While I don't fly huge jets or fly rich people around in their private jets which are much worse contributors, the airplanes I fly are still ""dirty"" and still burn a lot of fuel.\n\nThat said...\n\nThere is one company near my neck of the woods who in December 2019 had the first test flight of their in development, all electric converted DHC-2 Beaver float plane. This company has future plans to convert their entire fleet of aircraft to all electric if it goes well with their first prototype. Their operations would allow them to transition to electric because their airplanes typically do several short hop flights then return to base. Electric airplanes have a highly reduced flight time, and therefore range, than fuel counterparts because batteries are very heavy and the energy density is much, much lower than fuel. So my guestimation is their airplanes would have around 1.5 hours of flight time. This company is currently also carbon neutral by (I think?) contributing to recycling companies or something like that.\n\nThis had me really excited because I thought ""wow. I'd be able to keep doing what I love and feel good about it, if I worked for them."" This is the only company I am aware of that is doing this, though.\n\nRealistically this is a long way out, provided their plans work as intended. So this disheartened me.\n\nI'm in a personal battle between wanting to keep doing what I love, and being a more mindful, sustainable person not only in everyday life but with my occupation. Honestly, it's hard for me to understand why more people, especially those with families, kids, grandkids are not sort of freaking out about where the planet is heading and what it means for our descendants. The future of our species is being decided by us, now. What we, as humans, do over the next few decades either means a very difficult and ugly, or prosperous life for our families and theirs. I don't even have a family of my own and it greatly concerns me.\n\nWhile in this battle I'd love to hear some suggestions for some environmentally sustainable careers I may be able to use the skills I've attained as a pilot to transition to more easily... Or some good resources for researching this.\n\nThanks!"

I'm passionate about those everyday lifestyle changes that make a big difference, ""if only the norm was to do X"" kinda thing.\n\n2. I care about what is morally right and fair, I'm realistic about things not being perfect and I dislike the super environmentally friendly people having to live unrealistically to make up for those that are selfish or ignorant.\n\n3. I've found a degree in sustainability that I would like to take, this will take 4 years.\n\n4. I would like a job where I help a company or companies change their norms to be more sustainable and hopefully where I can help the employees to alter their daily life to be better balanced too. Happy for this to be government or private.\n\nSo I really have tried to research but I'm coming up short and a lot of the time it seems that I need to figure out the right questions before I can get the right answers.\n\nWhat do you do for work, how did you start, are there any junior roles I can apply for before I'm qualified? \n\nAny advice would be fantastic.

gkxvaz,"Thinking About Sustainability-Related Master's in New Zealand – Good Idea? I just graduated from a university in the United States with a bachelor's in Political Science and minors in History and Sustainability Studies. Although I’ve lived in the US my whole life, I also have hereditary United Kingdom and New Zealand citizenship.\n\nI originally planned to spend a couple of years working either in the US or abroad before worrying about getting a higher degree, but COVID-19 and the current state of the job market have made this untenable. Now, I’m thinking that if I can’t find full-time employment, it might be best to go ahead for a master’s. And by far the most affordable option would be to do it in New Zealand (I’m aware that studying in New Zealand means that I'd probably be ""stuck"" in the country as far as careers go, and that’s a prospect I’m definitely fine with).\n\nThe main dilemma is that postgraduate degrees are highly specialized, whereas I’m a generalist excited about anything relating to politics, society, and the social sciences. But sustainability and environmental issues are likely what I am most interested in and where I would like to spend my career.\n\nI’ve been researching potential degrees (including those along the lines of Environmental Studies, Sustainable Business, and Climate Change Science and Policy) and careers (i.e. public agencies, nonprofits, and private-sector sustainability), but this has just made me more indecisive.\n\nThe most important thing for me is that I’m doing something which I enjoy and which I believe has a positive societal impact. But after that, career prospects are my top priority. I went through my undergraduate with no strategy besides just taking courses that seemed interesting, and even though I went to a prestigious university and made good grades, this has rendered me unemployable. I’m desperate to avoid making the same mistake again.\n\nI’ve heard lots of contradictory pieces of advice, but the general impression I’ve gotten is most green jobs are in hard sciences and engineering, whereas the more generalized, less STEM-focused jobs are relatively rare and extremely competitive. This has honestly made me feel pretty lost and worried about whether this whole idea is a dead end.\n\nThis is obviously a major decision, so I don’t expect to get all the answers from Reddit. But if anyone is able to offer relevant insight, advice, experience, or resources for finding more information – either about whether this is a good idea in general, about sub-disciplines I should look into, or about specific universities/programs – it would definitely be appreciated."

I'm aware that there's SO many ways to work towards sustainability - in fact I currently work part-time for a beauty company that's vegan/cruelty-free and is developing zero-waste products. Thing is, I'm not earning enough right to make a living off of my position, and I need to find something more concrete. \n\n[This](https://www.facebook.com/events/843312909492893/) webinar coming up this week is a tiny example of what I mean. I just really want to know more about what's out there - like, how do you get into a track with a biochemical job where you get to work on finding alternatives to plastic? Are there positions in hospitals where you get to move the hospital towards zero-waste/emissions? How about working for the government to improve our public transport? Things like that, it's just so broad. Of course being a wildlife biologist or a park ranger seems awesome but I guess since I'm almost 30 those fun sounding jobs unfortunately don't seem realistic to me and I do feel I'd kind of like to work more in a city-setting, but working to bring nature into the city if that makes sense. \n\nTL;DR: WHERE ARE THE IN-DEPTH RESOURCES TO LEARN ABOUT JOBS IN SUSTAINABILITY...if there's not already thorough resources on this, there needs to be.

Worldwide, it’s estimated that over 17 million tonnes of electronic waste has gone to landfill this year alone.\n\nOur main motivation is to change how electronic products are manufactured and to disrupt the throwaway culture that’s so deeply ingrained today.\n\nTypically a device like an air purifier will be made from multiple different virgin plastics, usually permanently bonded or clipped together with no thought to the product’s end-of-life.  \nFor Briiv, we’ve made sure each component we designed was both derived from a natural source and could easily decompose or be recycled at the end of its life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wyqit1gp75051.png?width=1426&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64b1aecb39c1bc0bc7374d6372a9e09f3aaccaa8\n\nAfter working within the design industry for over 10 years, we wanted to use our knowledge of materials and circular design to prove that you can make sustainable electronics and to start discussions within the design community to consider using more sustainable alternatives to traditional materials.\n\n**THIS IS AN EXCERPT.

I was born and raised in Brooklyn near the Gownus canal and I love my home. Ever since our lockdown had me out of work I've been bored and want to do something worthwhile. I've been researching floating gardens that help filter things like nitrogen and phosphorus, maybe even help restore more oxygen. There's not a lot of good help online and need someone with knowledge of plants that would help heal the canal and boost it's ecosystem. I'm also interested in suggestions on additions that would help the floating garden thrive and help in multiple ways.\n\nI'm hoping to find people who are knowledgeable on such topics that are willing to give advice so that I can make a project with my downtime that's worthwhile and helps. Please feel free to comment or DM me if you'd rather stay private. Thanks for taking the time to read this."

Do you guys think we will ever start to see this “shift” away from human-centric research in the life sciences? It’s kind of disappointing to see that 90% of biotech is concentrated around human medicine (genetics, pharma, medical devices, prosthetics, etc).\n\nThis is what I’m worried about; The current trend in the life science industry, since the emergence of medicine as an industry, has been \n\nsmall molecule drugs —&gt; macromolecular products (proteins, nucleic acids) —-&gt; genetic manipulation (current uprising). \n\nI’m afraid that only after the genetic era, will there be a frantic shift towards eco centric research, which IMO will be too late at that point. I understand that funding is virtually non existent for environmental related research but doesn’t there HAVE to be some sort of wake up call in the next decade or so that if we don’t get our shit together we’re screwed?"

gx1h1p,"Why you need impact startup **7 reasons why creation of even small impact startup is the best exercise for your development**\n\n1. You’ve spent a lot of money and time on “self-awareness” training? How about the results? What if I told you there is another, maybe less daunting way which supports self-development? Launching a startup immediately reveals who you are in all your glory (or quite an opposite). It shows all your weaknesses and deficits – lack of essential hard and soft skills. It is the best test to understand how much you can offer to others. No mindfulness training will be able to deprive you from illusions in such a short time as a startup will do. It will open a box with your most horrible scares. But it’s the only way to grow. Development it’s not about following your dream but mostly getting rid of internal fears. \n\n2. Do you suffer from procrastination, lack of purpose in life, low motivation, self-pity, uncertainty and lack of confidence? Business will make you fanatically focused. Even the smallest tiny impact startup will swallow all your time and attention. As someone once said: when I’ve started my business, I slept at nights as a baby – waked up every three hours and cried. \n\n3. You feel lonely, all by yourself? People don’t understand you and you don’t have real friends? Impact startup will teach you how to understand people because you should be able to recognize customers, partners and potential employees. You will have to learn how to feel people’s desires, and what they actually want. It will improve your communications skills and will save you from numerous misunderstandings in the future. \n\n4. Impact startup will take time initially reserved in your schedule for social talks, favorite TV serials, social networks, meditation and spiritual practices. But at the same time, it will give energy and determination. It will teach you how to learn and work 10 times faster than you used to. Impact startup will teach you how to deal with problems and how to see possibilities instead of obstacles. How to overcome circumstances and get what you want. You will forget the word “impossible”. It will teach you not to spare yourself, stop complaining, become more productive. You will understand that stability is a lack of opportunities. You will start to respect yourself.\n\n5. Impact startup will teach you how to earn money, when income depends on your personal efforts, and there are no restrictions. Many people consider entrepreneurs greedy. In reality everything is the opposite. Most of the hired people are greedy because income is limited and they have to stay in budget, save money and forget about the wishes. In other words: always limit themselves. \n\n6. Money from your startup will give you various opportunities to help others. The more successful you become, the more people can benefit from it. Money is absolutely necessary resource if you want to change the world. Impact startup will teach you how to handle money, treat them not as a goal, but as a means for common goods. At least, if you hate money, the more you earn, the more you can burn. \n\n7. And the last thing. Most of the hired positions are limited with age and skills criteria. Impact startup is always open to you. You can start it tomorrow, even today. It gives you unlimited growth, makes you the master of life, open up the whole world. You will be able to create something which you will pass to your children. Just think about it. \n\nWe invite you to become a part of Galileo, a community of social entrepreneurs and impact investors changing the world for the better – [www.iiic.ch/membership](http://www.iiic.ch/membership)"

The wide metal slats seem like they’d let soap slivers drop through. The height of the baskets don’t seem right for preventing soap from slipping off the edge easily.

This combining of disparate materials, makes them non-recyclable.\n\nHaving said that, I imagine any “paper” coffee bags sold at markets or online are also mixed with an inter plastic lining, making them  non-recyclable as well. Don’t just take someone’s word for it, when inquiring online. \n~The marketing industry Is deceptive~\n\nInstead, take your reusable organic cotton/muslin bags to a place that offers whole bean dispensers, and refill them. Be sure you know how much each bag weighs so the cashier doesn’t over charge you. \n\nDue to COVID19 virus, many markets have temporarily changed their policies. So before you head out, take a brown paper bag or a plastic produce bag that you already have and reuse them. Contact your market and ask if they still  offer brown paper bags for coffee dispensers. If they don’t, ask if you can bring your own reusable bag for dispensing coffee beans.  If you can’t, tell them that your religion prohibits you from using anything unnatural. Ok,I’m joking... kind of.\n\nAs for the markets that do offers brown paper bags for coffee, don’t just use them once and throw them away, reuse the hell out of it! In fact, reuse the plastic produce and shopping bags as well, including the new thinner bags.\nIf they’re dirty, wash them let them dry and reuse them all! Markets want to bypass the BS and pack everything you buy in plastic bags. Be proactive and ask them not to and put your own groceries in your own bags instead. \n\nFact is, not all municipal recycling centers accept the same things and that recycle symbol on many items doesn’t mean it’s recyclable everywhere. So reuse paper and plastic bags, use your own reusable cotton bags, and go online to find out how and where to take it when you can’t reused it anymore, to make. \n\n\n[Are “Foil” Coffee Bags recyclable? ](https://www.providencejournal.com/article/20150109/LIFESTYLE/301099968) makes the end product impossible to recycle, because the two components can’t be separated"

h9rzos,"My Sustainable Wardrobe I am new to Reddit and the sustainability movement. Although I have been investing in products that have a lower impact on the planet and I feel I have a long way to go. i recently made a video about several clothing brands that I think people should know about.   \n\n\nPlease give me some feedback guys, I am really happy to be a part of this community.  \n[https://youtu.be/XnfIII\_3rYw](https://youtu.be/XnfIII_3rYw)\n\n  \n\n\nBrands \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bestseller** \n\nBestseller, which is the parent company of Only &amp; Sons and Jack and Jones considers sustainability holistically.\n\nTheir first sustainability strategy was published twenty years ago. \n\nThe company refers to its sustainability strategy as their “North Star,” and continues to set new goals to meet. \n\nTheir holistic strategy aims not only to counter climate change but to use resources more efficiently and to promote human rights. \n\nI had the opportunity to learn about their first two goals while visiting Best Seller’s headquarters in Denmark in October and learning about Only &amp; Sons and Jack &amp; Jones and, coincidentally, my partner learned about the third at her job around the same time. \n\nIf made unsustainably, it could almost 1000 gallons of water to make one pair of jeans. Jack &amp; Jones uses Jean-ology (a technology) that has enabled it to halve its use of water and it has also eliminated the use of bleach in washing jeans to lighten them, and eliminated the use of salt. The jeans themselves also use more sustainable blend of fabrics. \n\nMy partner learned about Bestseller’s involvement in HERProject. Bestseller is one of two Catalytic members of HERProject, which is an organisation that aims to improve lives of women working in the global supply chain through providing interventions to improve health, financial inclusion, and gender equality. Since 2007, HERProject has reached over 1 million women and 450 thousand men with programmes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt’s inspiring that such a large company has taken a definitive stance to lead the industry not only on environmental sustainability but on sustainability-related to human rights as well. Bestseller products are well made and affordable and demonstrate that you can be well dressed, have a good conscious, and &lt;something about breaking the bank.&gt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Peregrine** \n\nPeregrine is a British company, established in 1796. They spécialisé high quality knitted garments. \n\nPeregrine has created a Zero Waste collection, which is a collection of six styles of summer shirts made from BCI Egyptian cotton. BCI stands for the better cotton initiative and is a regulator. The line is made in Britain. \n\nI have the (name). It’s one of the softest shirts I have ever put on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tretorn**\n\nTretorn was established in 1891. Today, innovation and sustainability is core to their business. \n\nNot only are their products sustainably created, but they are incredibly innovative and solutions-driven. Some of their incredible initiatives include using leftover fabric from other companies in their clothing to reduce waste and recycling old fishing nets dumped into the ocean in their clothing. Tretorn is working on creating a 100% biodegradable light rain jacket - made from plant fabric, using plants like sugarcane and tapioca.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A Day’s March** \n\nA Day’s March is a Swedish Brand founded in 2014 when Marcus Gundo, Pelle Lundquist, and Stefan Pagreus quit their day jobs to focus on something more meaningful. \n\nThe three aimed to create clothing that helped get through the triumphs and troubles of everyday life. \n\nLike Best Seller, A Day’s March is always striving to do better. I really admire how the designers are constantly pushing themselves and their brand to become more sustainable, and it’s honestly one of my favourite brands. The quality is just unreal. \n\nA Day’s March creates their clothing using mostly organic cotton with local fabrics and materials in Portugal, which not only minimises the impact on the environment but can really be seen in the quality. \n\nTheir motto is to make clothes without an expiry date. Their clothing is long-lasting, not just in craftsmanship but in style, and counters the fast fashion waste. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kasti** \n\nKasti is a Scandinavian brand, born in Sweden and now based in Copenhagen. They make slippers and bags. \n\nAll their slippers are handmade in either Italy or Portugal. \n\nThese slippers are made to be used outdoor or indoors and are made from sustainable deerskin leather. The lining is goat leather. Having a pair of outdoor slippers has been revolutionary for taking the dog outside! \n\n**Amendi** \n\nAmendi was founded out of a genuine disappointed in a lack of transparency around sustainability, and companies “jumping on the green trend.” Two friends who were veterans of the fashion industry founded the company, which is committed to an unprecedented level of transparency and honesty. \n\nAmendi’s clothing comes with a “fabrication facts” tag, which, along with usual information about the fabric composition, includes how the cost is distributed and even approximately how many people worked on it. Their website provides details on where your item has travelled to get to you - from where the fabric was harvested, loomed, to how delivered. \n\nAmendi believes that sustainability is the bare minimum. They source organic, recycled materials, and design towards timeliness. \n\nI think this quote from their website says it all: “the goal is not just to sustain, it is to rejuvenate.”\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/h9rzos)"

A few years ago, I got very excited after reading a book about Transition Towns, which were intentionally designed communities where residents had a shared interest in sustainability. I was sad to see, therefore, that this idea apparently didn't have much traction: If you look at the [Transition Networks site](https://transitionnetwork.org/) for example, it looks like it's essentially been abandoned - very few, if any, updates on their map.\n\nI'd very much like to find, or build, a community of like-minded people. Does anyone know of any networks to find such a community, or ideas on building community where you live? \n\nFWIW I live in the suburbs of a large Southern city but would very much like to move to a more rural area, ideally in or near the mountains."

I have been working on an ongoing project for over 4 years now nick-named [“[Signs of collapse]”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.\n\nI try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.\n\nI define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.\n\nI’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.\n\nFeel free to share any of the material or repost this on other suitable subreddits. If you would like to get involved in this project, don’t hesitate to chat me up.\n\n**Previous posts:**\n\n* [Signs of collapse 2020 Q1](https://reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/ft8pjc/signs_of_collapse_2020_q1/)\n\n* [Signs of collapse 2019](https://reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/eikj2g/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year/)\n\n* [Signs of collapse 2018](https://reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/abicrb/signs_of_collapse_2018/)\n\n* [Signs of collapse 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/7oqcc0/signs_of_collapse_2017/)\n\n* [Signs of collapse 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/)\n\n--------------------\n\n# **Signs of Collapse 2020 Q2**\n \n**Police riots in the US**\n\n* [Shooting of Breonna Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Breonna_Taylor)\n* [‘I Can’t Breathe!’: Video Of Fatal Arrest Shows Minneapolis Officer Kneeling On George Floyd’s Neck For Several Minutes](https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/05/26/george-floyd-man-dies-after-being-arrested-by-minneapolis-police-fbi-called-to-investigate/)\n* [The Police Are Rioting.

If we need to consume less right now and in the future, why do we still go in shops or website, that, in there intrinsic logic, make you consume more by advertising or just selling different products?\n\nThe idea would be to create a website that will make you change your reflection on consumption and propose you to buy only the product you really need and you are looking for.\nFor example I want to buy a shirt and I don't know anything about sustainability or slow fashion. I go on this special website because I know that at the end I will have a sustainable shirt.\nI just arrive on the page and say that I need a shirt. Then, instead of arriving on a full page of clothes, the website ask me a simple question like ""do you really need it ?""\nI answer and the website tells me ""do you already have one?"". \nI answer again and the website says ""ok maybe you can check second hands shops that may have what you need"" and makes me fulfill some details about size, colours.. and make a selection of second hand shirts.\nI don't want to buy second hand so I can chose to go for a new product. The website makes a selection of the available ethical shirt on the page without any other products or advertising. \nAt the end I have what I was looking for, I learned some information one the way and some questions that I will ask myself next time when I would ne d to buy something.\n\nFor me by changing the logic behind the consumption we will make the difference. And so by proposing only one product for a research on a website, we will make people buy less products maybe?\nJust tell me if that makes sense for you, it is just an idea I had and I wanted people to debate on that idea."

I'm on board with less consumption and working less.  I've been down the road mentally on this issue for a couple of weeks, but have yet to approach my employer about it.  Ultimately, it doesn't seem fair to lower wage earners to push this... maybe I'm missing something?   Please help because I'd really like this to go somewhere!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I can afford it, but some can't.   My household income at full time employment is over $150k.   I can drop my hours by 20% and still live quite comfortably.  I'd pull that 20% from discretionary spending and a bit of monthly savings.   THIS MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE for people with little discretionary budget, and little monthly savings.  I think this further separates low earners from higher earners.  At some pay rate, people still have to work 40+ hours and still have no discretionary budget or savings budget.\n2. Insurance.  I'm in the US, and the 'full time' employee definition varies from state to state for insurance eligibility, and still yet from employer to employer.  In order to be considered full time and be eligible for employer sponsored health insurance in my state, you have to AVERAGE 30 hours per week of WORKING time.  So, sick and vacation time may pull down that average, and make you ineligible for employer sponsored health insurance coverage.  I checked out [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov) for some options, and it seems like if you want something affordable, it's for catastrophic coverage only.  (meaning, you pay for all of the small stuff, but if something big happens, you're covered, and covered well.  Therefore, it would be very hard for a single parent, or a single earner household to reduce hours and threaten full time status, even if they could afford the income loss, the health insurance costs would make it un-affordable.\n3. Stigma.   I can't help but think that below a certain income level, someone working less than 40 hours would be considered lazy.  Conversely, image a single someone who earns $200k reducing their hours by 20% and then earning $160k.  Still quite well off, and taking an extra day off per week they would potentially look even more successful than they are.  Poor people work less = lazy, Rich people take a day off = luxury.\n\nThere may be more, I may be way off base.  I'd love to get some perspective here."

I haven’t narrowed down exactly what aspect and I’ve still got schooling ahead of me (graduate degree, I have my undergrad), so I’m just looking for general suggestions to further look into. This is partially prompted by my desire to learn a second language. I’m an American with a desire to live abroad and travel, so I think it’s important for me to speak another language besides English. At the moment, I’m leaning towards French because I took it in school when I was younger, and it would open doors for me in France, Belgium, and Switzerland which all seem to be progressive with strong emphasis on sustainability. It could also potentially open doors for me in Africa if I perhaps worked in sustainable development or something. Anyways, I’m rambling now but would love to hear your ideas! Thank you :,)"

It doesn’t matter if you’re just starting out in this direction — small changes in your habits can have a substantial effect.** \n\n\* **Buy local** to reduce your carbon footprint and give back to your community. Know where your food is coming from and how it’s produced — pick sustainable products!   \n\* Have your **food delivered** \- home delivery is like public transport for groceries. Instead of having 20 odd cars make their way to the supermarket, one vehicle drives around delivering to everyone. Also, this means, you’re less likely to impulse buy, which can reduce any waste food.   \n\* Find **alternative storage methods** to reduce waste — use aluminium to pack food, or opt for beeswax-based products that sustainable store food, are easy to wash, and are even reusable. Buy reusable jars &amp; cups, instead of single-use plastic bottles, utensils and straws.   \n\* If you have let your food go, then be sure to **compost it**. Not only will this help create a natural fertiliser and keep your garden clean, but it’ll also reduce overall waste.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dyc7f3akpcb51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88b4b077485f40798e3ef80aa6a16bb466e1838e"

I've only recently become more woke to climate issues over the past months, so here are the specs:\n▫️ 4 bdrm house + 2 baths + 2 living rooms, all appliances are gas powered (water, heating, cooking stove, ovens, fossil fuel grid powered) bc our house is definately not up to date with modern appliances. Recently as its been warming up here (US, Okla), we've switched on our AC, but our house is poorly insulated and the AC unit is old; therefore we always keep it on in order for there to be a comfortable temperature  :(, \n▫️We have 7 people in our household right now, which means we need to consume more electricity, gas, food and water\n▫️ I'm personally willing to go vegan for sustainability purposes (haven't committed myself yet), but my family doesn't want to cut out meat (we eat meat most days, we'll have maybe 1 or 2 days per week where we dont use beef). We use animal products almost every day\n▫️Personally, my car is a 2006 Ford Mustang, so it drinks up gas like crazy. Recently, I never use the ac or heating in my car unless absolutely necessary, and I keep the thermostat set to heat to make it easier on my engine and gas mileage. I can't substitute my driving for public transportation, unfortunately, due to my local town's infrastrucutre and my siblings depend on my driving.\n▫️I admit that I use single-use packaged food a lot because I don't have a lunch period at school.\n\nWith all this on the table, these are the problems that are bigger to tackle in my household. I'd like some advice on how I could cut down me and my family's carbon footprint, so if you savvy dudes could give me some advice, I'd be very grateful. Thanks!"

My understanding is that one major factor for increasing risk of wild fires in the US west and elsewhere is the increasing vapor pressure deficit. Vapor pressure deficit being the difference between the moisture in the air and the maximum amount of moisture the air can old. With temperatures rising, the air is capable of holding more moisture which leads to more vegetation being dried out. \n\nIf there were 10s of millions of these skysource machines in use, would it just exacerbate the VPD problem by causing the air to be even drier? Or would the amount of water pulled out of the air by millions of them be negligible and not have much impact?"

FROGE is only a month old and has already raised $ 100,000 (this weekends FROGE price) in donations for Cool Earth to help them aiding rainforest communities in the fight against deforestation - and ultimately, climate change (www.coolearth.org).\n\nThe FROGE token has a built in climate charity mechanism that donates 0,1% of every transaction with the token (buy/sell/transfer) to the Cool Earth cryptowallet. With only 2,000 holders, the FROGE community has donated around $ 100,000 to Cool Earth.

n4m4n9,"Looking for a truly global view on sustainability I think sustainability is viewed very differently in developing countries. Whereas in countries like the US where overconsumption is becoming a big problem, in countries like the Philippines we need to consume more and more in order to prosper as an economy. I remember documentaries like Seaspiracy saying that not eating fish can save the planet. I agree on that statement, I really do. But the thing is, many developing countries, particularly in coastal communities, rely on fish to make a living and feed their families. What do you think about this?\n\nIn terms of climate crisis, there's also a very stark difference. Developed countries are starting to invest heavily on renewable energies, whereas many developing countries still have to rely on the usual non-renewable sources in order to accelerate economic growth. The current pace of renewable energies, I think, is not yet enough to aid in the growth of developing countries.\n\nMeanwhile, developed countries are better positioned to not take current responsibility for the climate crisis because their days of rapid industrialization are long gone. Developed countries are so 'developed' that they have the capacity to quickly shift to new, sustainable technologies. Developing countries, however, are just beginning to industrialize and without doing so, we wouldn't progress (e.g., China). So it's hard to place accountability on who or what should really be responsible for climate change. \n\nThe way I see it, there really has to be some kind of change in the world order. A mindset that focuses on economic growth not based upon endless growth, but one that's based on a communion with nature and the planet. Through this mindset, a lot of the old and antiquated systems that we have will be forced to change for the betterment of the common good. There also has to be some kind of technology and knowledge exchange between countries that'll allow this to happen. \n\nDo you think this is something possible in a few decades' time, while the clock's already ticking FAST for our planet? Couple that with many ongoing geopolitical issues and I can't help but feel overwhelmed and hopeless sometimes."

I'll definitely be interesting in watching this doc when I get the chance, but in the meantime can anyone point me in the direction of studies/papers either for or against this claim? As of right now I'm skeptical at best, though my recent reading of the book *The Omnivores Delimma* has piqued my curiosity about the possibility of sustainably farmed meat in places like Polyface Farm, referenced in the book.\n\nThanks!"

n5atp8,"Advice on making sure food is from the UK/ethical diet? Hi everyone,\n\nI've been having a bit of a weird one recently. It dawned on me the other week that the line I was drawing between humans and animals was arbritrary, and the ethical diet to have was vegan. This took me down a rabbit hole, but I've found that there are many concerns about veganic agriculture as well. Slavery on farms, unsustainable for soil, long shipments across the world, etc. It seems like everywhere I step, I contribute to suffering. I think one of the most important things I should consider, is that my food comes from the UK, where I live. Also, if I can confirm the animal didn't suffer in its life, eat local meat over soy from far away. Not wasting food is a big must as well. Is this about the closest I can get to an ethical diet? Does anyone know of any tools I can use to make sure my food is from the UK/doesn't involve animal suffering? I imagine no matter what I do, I contribute to some suffering, but I want to minimise it as much as possible.\n\nIt just feels like going vegan and eating any old thing that's been farmed halfway across the world, feels like a cop out. For background info, I don't have the means to live on a permaculture farm or anything like that. I'm a young, healthy, city dweller, with no dietary requirements beyond the normal. \n\nThanks everyone!"

Do you think it should be called environmental economics and first suggested by universities without telling us its political leaning?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI'm a 3rd year sustainability major that needed an economics credit this semester, and thus chose 'environmental economics', also called 'free market environmentalism'. However after taking the class it seems like anything but environmental. The class taught me that government is almost always inefficient and that handing public lands over to ""enviropreneurs"" would make us profit and benefit the environment. \n\nYet in application it only seems to succeed in commodifying natural capital for human profit and fails to see any value in anything that isn't profitable. They cherry-picked the same 'successes' repeatedly (barbed wire helped establish property rights, white rhinos were saved from extinction by farming their horns). I was even told at one point that Malthus and Ehrlich were fools for being concerned about population expansion, as 'technology has always solved the issue'. Essentially it was a soapbox for the privatization of the environment, and the unfettered expansion of human enterprise.\n\nI couldn't seem to get through a single lecture without hearing something that directly contradicted my other sustainability courses, which caused me to do some research. The main disseminator of this information is the Montana based Property and Environment Research Center (PERC), which conveniently doesn't mention that it's an associate member of the Koch brother's State Policy Network (SPN). A brief skim of the team shows a roster of all white mostly male individuals, which of course could only mean good things. \n\nMy university didn't tell me that this was going to be a contradictory course sponsored by a conservative think-tank.  Or perhaps it's not contradictory, and I just need to give it a chance? I'm having trouble not emailing my office of effective courses and planning and requesting they put a disclaimer on the course, or at least make it a non-credit elective. I just wanted to learn about the *many* economic avenues of environmentalism, not one straight shot to promoting Nestle bottled water.\n\nSimply put, do you all think this is useful class for sustainability majors? Do you think it should be called environmental economics and first suggested by universities without telling us its political leaning?\n\nSuggested reading: \n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232922184\_Free\_Market\_Environmentalism\_Friend\_or\_Foe](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232922184_Free_Market_Environmentalism_Friend_or_Foe)\n\n[https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Property\_and\_Environment\_Research\_Center](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Property_and_Environment_Research_Center)\n\n[https://www.perc.org/about-us/people/](https://www.perc.org/about-us/people/)"

n89160,"Youtube channel ""What I've Learned"" is shamelessly spreading misinformation After several blatantly dishonest videos in the past, WIL's latest video titled ""Eating less meat won't save the planet"" was the final straw. Those familiar with the topic immediately realize that the video is filled with lies and doesn't include a shred of convincing evidence for its bold claims.\n\nEven Frank Mitloehner, the ""expert"" featured in the misleading video, has been frequently criticised for being heavily influenced by the livestock industry (e.g.: [https://clf.jhsph.edu/sites/default/files/2019-04/frank-mitloehner-white-paper-letter.pdf](https://clf.jhsph.edu/sites/default/files/2019-04/frank-mitloehner-white-paper-letter.pdf)).\n\nThe subject of the video makes it particularly problematic. The most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet even found, for example, that avoiding meat and dairy products is the ['single biggest way'](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth) (!) to reduce your environmental impact on the planet. But while it is scientific consensus that reducing the consumption of animal products is crucial for climate and environmental protection, people are always ready to listen to somebody telling them they don't have to change. WIL's video has already been watched by around 1 mio. people, thus causing enormous damage and misinformation.\n\nMany Youtubers have already responded to WIL's anti-scientific video. My favorite response comes from Earthling Ed: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkMOQ9X76UU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkMOQ9X76UU) - Please watch &amp; spread the video if you can!\n\nWhether environment-related or not, misinformation on YouTube (and elsewhere) ultimately harms society at large and needs to be called out and broadly rejected."

Do I take it out of the cardboard, cut open the plastic packaging and dump the food then go from there? \n\nI'm frankly overwhelmed by all of this and just want to declutter as mindfully as possible. None of these items can be donated in their current condition.  \n\nAll help and insight is greatly appreciated."

I read somewhere that developing countries are more concerned with innovation and economic growth than they are with sustainability. I think it makes sense, because before even becoming ""sustainable"", there's a lot of technology and innovation requirement, which developing countries don't even have yet. I wonder — do you think the current alternative energy sources we currently have are capable of meeting the growth demands of developing countries? How can developing countries reach a developed status without sacrificing sustainability? \n\nSounds like a double-edged sword to me. What's more is that many people in developing countries don't even know what ""sustainability"" is. It's basically just a buzz word to them. They're more concerned with increasing wealth and consumption, because clearly that's the only way to become a developed country. What do you think about this? I'm asking because (1) I live in a developing country myself and (2) most of the sustainability subs I find in Reddit are focused on developed countries or the West. I struggle to find a discussion about this aspect of sustainability, specifically on developing countries."

So, when buying your candle they can be tiny for kids of large for adults and teens. Anyway, buy your candle and let it run out. Instead of throwing it away, scrape out the excess wax from the bottom of the candle. All you will need for this is soap, water, and a butter knife (non plastic). The soap and water will make the small amount of wax in the candle fall out. Use the butter knife to glide out where the candle wick was. They are usually made of medal these day but trust me it’s easy to just gently glide out. Once everything is out of the candle.

ndvnmk,"Eco-Friendly Green Banking: A Sustainable Strategy Consumers are becoming increasingly socially conscious and expect the companies they work with to adopt practices that match their values. This trend is evident throughout many retail sectors and is penetrating the global banking industry as well. Across the financial services industry, we are witnessing a massive push toward sustainability. Whereas sustainability might have once been thought of as paperless statements and digital cards, today it is more often thought of as (environmental, social, and government) factors. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn that vein, a number of financial institutions have rolled out “green deposits” to involve their customers in deciding where a bank will allocate funds. Part and parcel of that strategy is shifting away from causes that negatively impact ESG (think private prisons and fossil fuel-producing corporations) toward more socially conscious causes. Take a study from Deloitte, which found that three out of every five customers in the U.K. said they wanted their bank to focus more heavily on “creat\[ing\] a positive, social, and environmental impact.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThough not as developed in this way as their European counterparts, American banks are beginning to understand the importance of taking meaningful action with respect to implementing ESG-positive policies. Whether with respect to racial justice, or fighting climate change, or promoting gender equality, US banks are shifting course. However, many acknowledge big US banks are not moving quickly enough and are lacking in a key regard: namely eco-friendly strategies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere, green challenger banks and neo-banks are increasingly filling the void. Take, for example, Aspiration, a California-based neo-bank committed to making a positive impact on the climate with their users’ money. By sponsoring a sustainable mutual fund, Redwood Fund, and creating initiatives like PlantYourChange (which allows users to plant trees with their spare change), Aspiration has capitalized heavily on consumer interest in environmental impact. Moreover, their growth over the past few years has shown that successful neo-banking does not have to come at the expense of the climate, but rather can come from investing in clean and green. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA future of eco-friendly green banking that puts sustainability front and center is here and ready to be capitalized on. Our climate, and indeed our world, are too important to no longer treat this issue as the pressing one it is. One of the most effective ways we can do that is bank sustainably and support the burgeoning industry of eco-friendly green banking. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0nyk25ou8jz61.png?width=650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=adc6426e240a84d6dfaa1242b0a02c26d248ad81"

I keep thinking about all of the things I use and love day to day and how they harm the environment. After so many hours of research, it feels like 99% of the things I do contribute to emissions. I am typing this very Reddit post on a keyboard on a decent pc setup. A setup comprised of parts from a factory contributing to the destruction of the environment. Not only that but the industrial-sized electric generators that keep my electricity running are likely powered by fossil fuels, and that is something out of my control. So should I stop using computers altogether if they harm the environment that much? Not only that, but I am a music lover at heart, and I am fully aware of the terrible damage vinyl does to our environment. That's one of the reasons I do not like vinyl. But even so, doesn't the production of music equipment kill the environment and produce more emissions? The same can be said for the pressing of CDs and cassettes. So should I stop buying music physically altogether? Should I stop buying instruments and equipment? And even if we invest money in solar panels and wind power and carbon trapping, don't the production of these devices, in turn, produce MORE emissions? And what about far more crucial items we use every day? The clothes we wear? The food we eat? The devices we use? The money we give and take? Honestly, I couldn't imagine living without these things! \n\nIt all is just so confusing and worrying and makes my head spin. Don't get me wrong, I understand the companies are at fault for most of these emissions. I hate them all just as much as anyone should. I am working towards minimizing disposables and investing in electric alternatives as well. But do all of these electric alternatives mean anything if they are produced with MORE fossil fuels?? I understand my carbon footprint is not the be all end all solution to climate change, but I understand my voice and actions matter, and it feels like just existing in modern society harms the planet in one way or another."
nf6vsm,"Should C02 emission the only indicator of sustainability? The less exciting part of sustainability?\n\nThe part that asks about accountability and responsibility.\n\nDid you know that according to a report by the Bureau for the Appraisal of Societal Impacts for Citizen Information **(Coffee, behind the success story, 2018)**, in Peru and Ethiopia, each dollar linked to coffee exports in 2017 generated between 85 and 90 cents of hidden costs at the expense of these countries and their populations (the “societal costs”)?\n\n**So what is Societal Cost?**  \n**Societal cost (according to K. W. Kapp, 1963).**  \nAll direct and indirect, present and future losses and expenditure that are borne by third parties or the community as a whole due to the social, health and environmental impacts of production and consumption methods.\n\n**According to the Bureau for the Appraisal of Societal Impacts for Citizen Information, societal cost can be divided into 3 categories:**\n\n1. The first component concerns producers’ inability to earn enough income to permit them — and their family — to live in dignity.\n2. The second component of societal cost concerns local government spending on ensuring essential public services (education, healthcare, social affairs, water/electricity, transportation, justice, support for agriculture and environmental protection).\n3. The final component of societal costs concerns the emission of greenhouse gases all along the chain, from the grower to the final consumer.\n\n**To at least alleviate these challenges, the proposal is:**\n\n1. Demand a living income for farming communities in developing countries.\n2. Climate change may further marginalise more impoverished producers, as farmers with good access to capital and technology are more likely to manage emerging climate risk.  \nSo the private sector initiatives should share the costs and risks of climate-smart programs.\n3. Lack of transparency around pricing is supported by antitrust laws that protect companies against sharing price information, translating into brands telling sustainability stories without an economic element. Consequently, consumer trust in brand stories around farming is distorted as consumers already believe they support farmers’ livelihood, which translates into less willingness to pay more and lower demand for change from the consumer side (SCA, 2019). Hence, demanding full sustainability around pricing is paramount.\n\nWe need a framework for sustainability that seeks innovations beyond environmental practices that focus on energy, water, natural resources, pollution and waste management **into** social-economic inclusion.\n\nStand with us if you too believe that a full-time coffee farmer should be able to make a living income from their farm revenue.\n\nJoin the movement and spread the word."

nfgvr2,"My theory on why consumption is inherently unsustainable and how to fix it. Try poking holes in it. The Good Place hit the nail on the head when explaining why being good is becoming increasingly difficult. We can no longer handpick flowers and walk them to our grandma. Now, we order flowers (\*\*grown with pesticides\*\*) from a phone (\*\*made in a sweatshop\*\*) and delivered from thousands of miles away (\*\*carbon footprint\*\*). \[see below for their full rundown\]\n\n\_\_\_\n\nAnywho, I've been studying the economics of our consumption recently and came across an economics theory called 'The Theory of Externalities"". An externality is an impact on a third party that had nothing to do with the production or consumption of a product. In the case mentioned above, the third parties would be the people who deal with degrading soil from pesticides, the sweatshop workers and their poor treatment, and society as a whole from the effects of climate change.\n\nExternalities are supposed to be mitigated through Pigouvian Taxes (similar to a carbon tax or a tobacco tax), but companies always find ways to avoid them...whether it's through political pressure, or simply proving it hard to put a cost on an impact to someone else (how do you price the tax of poor soil quality to a nearby town?).\n\nTo me, it seems like there are two solutions, either we start voting in politicians who support policy we believe it (which we've all seen how successful this play is)...or we pay for the externalities produced by \*\*our consumption\*\*. What if when you bought the pesticide-ridden flowers, you also donated to an organization researching organic pesticides. What if when you bought those flowers on a sweatshop-produced cell phone, you also donated to an organization certifying the working conditions at phone manufacturers?\n\nBy definition, sustainability is the capacity to endure. If we are all mitigating the unintended consequences of the things we buy, wouldn't that make the system fundamentally more sustainable?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\nThe Good Place, Season 3 Episode 10, The Book of Dougs\n\n“In 1534, Douglas Wynegar gave his grandma roses for her birthday.

I don't like it because people constantly confuse the name with recycled plastics or re-anything else plastics. Also the first word is past tense and the second is plural which makes it really hard to spell and say.\n\nThe names I am thinking of are:\n\n[Earthpositivestore.com](https://earthpositivestore.com/) (that would be the url but you would just refer to the store as Earthpositive. I like it because the logo could be something nice and simple: EARTH+\n\n[Themoralstore.com](https://themoralstore.com/) half of the reason I built this site was so I could donate profits and truly make a good impact on the world. I know a lot of businesses say this in their marketing, but I am really passionate about it. We're going to try to help put on beach clean ups and engage communities and donate to local non-profits when you buy from us.\n\n[earthsavershop.com](https://earthsavershop.com/) I like this because it makes our buyers feel like a hero for shopping with us.\n\n[Conservewhatyoulove.com](https://conservewhatyoulove.com/) Although this is really long. I saw it on a mural and thought it was touching. Its similar to other names out there such as the eco friendly store: ""the future is good"". Abbreviated as [thefig.com](https://thefig.com/)\n\n[Ecossentialsstore.com](https://ecossentialsstore.com/) I combined Eco and essentials. Because we're selling home-essentials that are eco-friendly. Simple enough. The biggest problem I see with this URL is that it is a clever name but it doesn't invoke much emotion.\n\n[skiponplastic.com](https://skiponplastic.com/) I don't know if i like this one. Figured I would just put it in though. The problem is that it makes it seem like the only benefits of buying from plastic free goods is that you're buying goods without plastic however it's so much more than that (manufacturing process, energy usage, ethics, if our supplier donates, etc)\n\nI made a very quick google survey, if you could fill it out I would really really appreciate it :)\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXupYPQ2BFXzH-RL9mUWkJ9UTEjOAZCeYshFFCK3Qd9\_tQEQ/viewform?embedded=true](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXupYPQ2BFXzH-RL9mUWkJ9UTEjOAZCeYshFFCK3Qd9_tQEQ/viewform?embedded=true)\n\nThank you guys so much.

ngpnq5,"Our small individual actions collectively have impact bigger that we can imagine ... we can put it to use only if we pledge to ourselves to take that action “The past couple of decades, governments and large corporations have not managed to significantly change their behaviors, for numerous acceptable or \nunacceptable reasons. If corporations and governments continue on the same path of environment and sustainability inaction, \nthere is little change we can expect in the near future. Perhaps this narrative may change in the long run, as organizations start to see the impact of environmental inaction on their balance sheets.\nHypothetically, if five million regular single-use water bottle consumers decide to stop consuming one single-use water bottle a day and switch to reusable water bottles, that is nearly two billion fewer water bottles consumed in one year. That magnitude of change will bring about a big enough financial impact on the bottled water industry to either produce fewer single-use water bottles the following year or find environmentally palatable consumption alternatives.”\n- Green Your Routine by Omar Abad"
ngqlh6,"Impossible Packaging Decision Alright, so I have to make what is essentially an impossible packaging decision for my company, and I was hoping this community may be of help. I’ll lead by saying that my company cares about science, so we aren’t on a mission to only use X or never use Y. We’ll do what science indicates is ideal. \n\nSo here is the struggle: We produce clothing. We make sustainable performance apparel from primarily natural fibers. We’re meticulous about the environmental impact of our production. Now, we care about our packaging. We want to do away with plastic if possible, but it presents a lot of issues. Companies like Patagonia have kept plastic polymailers in their distribution because the goods need to be protected. Above all, the garments have to be kept safe, since they have a FAR greater environmental impact than the packaging. \n\nPlastic is amazing. It’s waterproof, it has low GHG emissions compared to paper, and it is theoretically recyclable. However, plastic packaging essentially isn’t recycled here in the US. The goods are shipped around the world, so the layer next to the garments needs to be waterproof and abrasion resistant. Plastic makes sense here. However, we’ve been looking at PLA/PBAT blend bio-plastic home compostable bags to replace that layer. They’re still waterproof, and they can be composted and they degrade in marine environments (as far as we can tell). The problem is they’re single use, not recyclable, virgin, and likely won’t be composted, since most people in the US do not compost. So our option is glassine (paper) next to the product, but that won’t protect it/plastic next to the product, but it’s plastic and not really recyclable/or bioplastic next to the product, but it will probably go to landfill and not break down in that environment.\n\nThen there’s the outer mailer itself. This can be plastic, bioplastic, or paper as well. Paper doesn’t protect as well,  and it has much higher GHG emissions up front and if composted. As for plastic and bioplastic, you get the gist. Most people in the US have access to paper recycling, so it seems like a win. But recycling is so energy and water intensive, plus the GHG cost upfront, that we get stuck in this cycle of impossible decisions. \n\nAny suggestions or resources out there? We would be incredibly grateful. I’m trying to become a resources for other companies in my field as well, so it could to a long way. \n\nCheers!"

ngzt4e,"Can social media be sustainable? Hey there Reddit and sustainability friends,\n\nto be transparent, this post has two purposes: asking you for help through a survey of ours &amp; opening up a discussion about the interplay between social sustainability and social networks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo first, let us introduce ourselves:\n\nWe’re a small start-up from Germany. We aim to offer a medium on where to begin with sustainability. Our mission therefore is, to unite individuals, grow networks, evolve them into initiatives, perform projects and become a sustainable movement that transforms.\n\nOur current main project is to develop an alternative to other social media platforms by encouraging and supporting real social connections instead of replacing them. So our main goal here is to connect people and help those people keep an overview about their connections in order for them to be able to flourish the best within their social environments. So basically, building meaningful connections and maintaining them instead of social fast food ;)\n\nAbout the survey:\n\n“The goal of this survey is to get a better understanding of how people use different networking tools to stay in touch with the people around them. We want to find out what functionality is vital to you and where changes could be made to create a more intuitive experience.”\n\nSo please, before you read any further, check out our survey and give us your opinion:\n\n[https://tripetto.app/run/UNKKF6G29M](https://tripetto.app/run/UNKKF6G29M)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my personal experience, I’ve never really witnessed any networking tools or social media truly addressing sustainability concerns. The closest to that, is probably the ever bigger debate about privacy concerns and so on.\n\nWhat I think, is not covered enough though, is the connection of these platforms to mental health. Most social media nowadays seems to be developed to be addicting to use, in order to increase usage time. E.g. algorithms that only show you what you want to see and what you’re interested in, might be a good example for that.\n\nFurthermore, the competition for popularity in e.g. Instagram, has led to people portraying their lives as hedonistically perfect by for example reaching certain beauty standards, traveling a lot, and so on.\n\nThis might be damaging to those who are not privileged enough to (ever) reach these ideals while also creating a narrative about life that promotes self-optimization and a total power of self-determination. One might even interpret this as manifesting social stereotypes and while doing so also manifesting unseen social hierarchies and thus also unseen systemic discrimination.\n\nThere are certainly more things to talk about here, that address mental health concerns in social media, such as social media wanting to become your main hub for social interaction and in such actively wanting to replace authentic real-life connections.\n\nThis issue here in also definitely not as black and white as it might seem from my portrayal thus far. Social media can also encourage connections by offering them a medium to find one another and connect even on a distance. So there is a very thin line here that needs to be taken into account in order to both reduce mental health issues related to social media while also providing the positive elements that come with it.\n\nSo, what do you think? Is mental health a topic related to social sustainability? What are other big social sustainability issues that need more attention when it comes to social media? How does Reddit fit into this picture?"

ni60li,"A mental roadmap that explains how we can make sustainability a reality through collective action. Some (or even many) say it’s impossible — mass collaboration. They cite that “humans have never collaborated in human history.” But, consider questioning those assumptions. First of all... collaboration is kind of our thing as humans, and it’s likely **required** right now on a mass scale to achieve sustainability and end critical world problems. Just because we haven’t done it before doesn’t mean that it’s impossible. \n\nIt might be a big leap in thought for many here, but just know that I’ve thought about this for like... 10 years, and I’m pretty thoroughly convinced that mass collaboration is possible and really smart as an idea to try out. \n\nYour first question might be — “why?”\n\nWhy do we need to collaborate to achieve sustainability and solve critical world problems? The answer is that we can likely only achieve sustainability through this kind of effort. \n\nIf you will, travel down this epiphany chain with me.\n\nThe first time I “woke up” was in Chemistry 101. The instructor woefully told us about our climate problems... and this was before it was trending as a topic. All of the scientific information that I had taken in up to this point suddenly made sense... of COURSE we have climate sustainability problems! We haven’t *ever* set out to make our world sustainable as humans, so why would it be? Achieving a sustainable climate became the most important thing in my life. How could it not be? It’s critical for our survival!\n\nBut the problem seemed SO... big. The magnitude was huge to me. Climate change appeared to me as an existential threat that was *interlaced* with every other facet of our society. There was no way we could solve it without changing **all parts** of how our world works. It’s our technology and industry and infrastructure that creates these emissions... and that’s the whole dang world! \n\nIt became clear to me that a massive change and a massive problem-solving effort was necessary. \n\nIt was so striking to think this. There’s actually **no way to solve climate change as if it were a problem existing in isolation.** We essentially would have to transform our society all at once to solve it. Could this even be possible? \n\nThat idea was so much different than what’s going on now. Right now, we have the MAX being a few governments working together on a few initiatives. Either that or collaborations between the UN and other agencies. But, this wasn’t close to what I saw/see as necessary if we wanted to transform the whole human world. We needed nearly everyone. \n\nSustainability is an “all hands on deck” problem. Everyone with the capacity to care needs to be in on solution-creation... and that’s what I see in one sense... but the key that was and *still* is missing is **mass** collaboration. \n\nWhat does that mean? Get this. It’s going to take ALL of those individual organizations, people, governments, **in coordination** and working collectively.  Like one central coordinated effort type thing. Why? \n\nWhat might it take to transform a society? How might we possibly manage that? \n\nI’ll tell you. The secrets are collaboration / crowdsourcing or crowdfunding.\n\nCollaboration could be used to create the vision of what our society could look like, and crowdfunding could be used to pay for the changes to be realized. Will it happen all at once? No. But we can enter into mass collaboration by starting to envision our new world and use that as a basis to start crafting new components to our society and getting the individual parts funded. \n\nHave I taken you too far? \n\nWhat part is impossible? \n\nThe important part is that we start now and test out our big ideas. Once we have the vision set (a sustainable, justice, awesome world) and we start building toward that with experiments, then we’ll be able to see **what works for us** and what doesn’t. Enough theoretical arguments about what’s most sustainable.. let’s try out ALL ideas through crowdsourcing efforts and see those ideas in action. We’ll be able to see what deserves our attention and investment. \n\nIs it a huge operation? Sure, but it starts small and we can bring in the smart people to help us coordinate this. It’s not impossible. \n\nThe cool parts about it? It’s something we can start now without needing government buy-in or permission. We simply start crowdsourcing. It also means that we get to write the rules of the future. Do we want UBI so people won’t be stuck to their current jobs and we can get rid of unsustainable ones? We can make that happen? Do we want parties every day? We can make that a “thing” because we’d be working together to make it happen. \n\nYes, I’m proposing that we activate *everyone* in this mass collaborative effort to transform the world to be sustainable and awesome. Is it a moonshot? Yes. But what other solutions seem viable when you actually think them through?\n\nOur current problem is that we have no clear path to implementing and scaling any of our proposed solutions for sustainability... I mean. People propose end points like “no plastic,” but rarely do they every suggest how we’ll actually get there. \n\nThis solution that is proposed here is the “how” for any big solution that needs to be implemented. \n\nI’m interested in writing a guide for exactly how we might do this, and any questions that you have will help me know what questions to answer. Please, ask away!\n\nComments like “that’s impossible” aren’t helpful, but giving a concrete example of why it might not be impossible could be helpful. Even better is to ask “how might we ________?”\n\nThanks for reading!"

(proposal - long read) Executive Summary - make Discords for sustainability projects and groups and special interest groups at the municipal level + college / university / community college campuses &amp; majors \n\n\+ discords at the county, regional, state, tri-state, national, international level \n\nfor cities, campuses, special interest groups, project categories.. discuss in side groups, update main group. \n\n\+ groups for a better 'universal platform network' \n\nIf you have a great organization or platform already - instead of everyone joining that - join this &amp; help &amp; join the 'universal platform network' group to discuss and promote your thing. \n\n\*\*\n\nI recently applied to be a ""Sustainability Outreach Coordinator"" for a small university town.\n\nEven more recently they informed me that they received a lot of great applications from a lot of great candidates this year - but mine wasn't top tier.. and they would be moving forward without me.\n\nWell, hopefully whoever gets in there does a great job and everyone likes them, and they help the town and go on to save the world.\n\nAnyway, I know this isn't the perfect pitch - but I'm still thinking its a good idea -\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I was researching / preparing - I went ahead and made a Google Drive to organize all the city projects and programs by category\n\n \+ links to city resource pages + links to participating organizations + links to similar projects in other cities - regional / state / tri-state / national..\n\nAnd the same for the university ""sustainability"" projects + ""sustainability"" majors &amp; faculty + sustainability groups + similar projects at other campuses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt could be helpful if more cities / climate councils / organizations / community groups / mutual aid groups.. made similar Drives to organize projects and links, and links to peers - for their category of interest and/or campus / city / state / tri-state / national / global projects and participating organizations.\n\nEven better if they shared with their peers, even better if they shared with everyone, even better if this lead to collaboration and coordination - including standard Drives at every level - and working-groups to develop ultimate collaboration / coordination platform /networks.\n\nBut Google Drive isn't all that great for discussion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of people are out there wanting to help good things get done - maybe getting some links on Reddit or Facebook and getting into arguments- but not knowing other parallel projects or local / regional / state projects, programs, or organizations.. or dis-satisfied with current options / membership commitments / cultures..\n\nAnd a lot of people, and groups, and organizations, and cities, and states - don't know about good projects and programs going on around them or good management platforms- apparently.\n\nBetter Municipal Organizational platforms would help, better cooperative networks would help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes your campus or city or organization or group have a good forum and platform to organize all the  local and regional eco-social sustainability / resilience / mutual aid / social ecology-esque...\n\nprojects and programs and groups and teams and organizations and shops and gardens and people who care about aquaponics and sustainable investing and..\n\nto better discuss and peer-review and demonstrate and coordinate and collaborate and help eachother with projects and programs locally, regionally, nationally,\n\nand / or by category and / or just for a specific category ?\n\nIf you are using an amazing coordination platform or forum, please share links below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've found there are some good organization / coordination / peer review / collaboration platforms and forums out there. But there are a lot of cities and organizations that aren't using them, and very few host multiple cities or organizations in a cooperative network, and very few are open to the public to see planning / discussion.\n\nSome are only made for one city, some are only made for one category of project..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut most everything would be easier and better if more cities and organizations and groups were using better cooperative organizational platforms - even better if they were using the best - even better if more cities and organizations (and political parties) and groups and campuses and college majors.. were using the same one in cooperative networks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow to get there - a ""Sustainability / Resilience"" municipal syndicalist platform and network for everyone?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRather than everyone trying to join existing platforms or organizations, or copying something that is isn't used by their neighbors..\n\nIt would probably be beneficial for all (or most) of the organizations in roughly the same category - food systems, housing / urban design, economics / finance, mutual aid / sharing, campus.. etc. to get together with their peers at the city, county, regional, state /province level to use existing platforms to form groups to discuss projects and programs..\n\nand also compare platforms and networks..\n\neven better if the heavy-hitters can form a 'Sustainability/ Resilience Municipal Platform Network' working-group-  to develop a better platform and network for everyone - and compare and test and de-bug and help spread.\n\nThe same way aquaponics supporters and projects, etc. should group up and peer-review.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you know anyone in a sustainable management or coordinator or organizer or platform developer position, feel free to suggest they use their amazing platform to start a group and get together with their peers.\n\nBut I still expect that might take a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the meanwhile.. I think the rest of us can get some good work done with Discord and Google Drives (and facebook and reddit and slack and linkedin and whatever else people are using)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImagine a Sustainability / Social Ecology / Municipal Syndicalist Discord for your city -\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSidebar Channels\n\nMajor Project Categories\n\n\- Food Systems\n\n\- Housing / Urban Design\n\n\- Sharing Economy / Consumption / Waste\n\n\- Eco-solidarity economy\n\nand so on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWorking Groups\n\n\- Food Waste Collection\n\n\- Time Bank\n\n\- Tool library\n\n\- Bike Path / Gardens\n\n\- Forest Fire prevention\n\n\- Amazing new municipal platform / network working group\n\nand so on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAffinity Groups\n\nCyclists for Sustainability\n\nCommunity Gardeners\n\nFoodies for sustainability\n\nParents for sustainability\n\nRestarurant owners for sustainability\n\nSustainable Investors\n\netc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then another discord for every college, university, and community college campus (maybe high-school?)\n\nCollege Majors\n\nSociology Majors for sustainability\n\nEnvironmental Science Majors for sustainability\n\nArts &amp; Media Majors for Sustainability\n\nBusiness Majors for Sustainability ?\n\netc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Of course each group should feel free to split off onto their own Discord server to discuss things and projects and links they care about in more depth,\n\n1. Or reddit sub, or facebook group, or slack, or whatever else people are using / comfortable with - probably good to have these anyway, to reach and help more people.\n2. but a few people / organizations will check back and forth with the main city / campus Discord / Drive to check and post updates, project links, answer questions, coordinate..\n\n\- How great to be able to see something similar for projects and groups in other campuses and cities in your region  - see the projects and discussion, and be able to bring links to good projects back to your city and working groups- Even better if there are Discords (and Drives) at the regional / state / tri-state / national levels - reviewing, discussing, comparing projects / coordinating / collaborating..\n\n1. My little town is only going to have a few people interested in any category, fewer participating in each group, fewer in each working-group, fewer committed to projects.. but other cities might have something going that we can see and copy, or help with, or have a development team,\n   1. if not other cities, then a working group at the regional or state level or tri-state level might make sense.\n2. It might be worthwhile to go ahead and start and fill out the groups for a Sustainability Discord for other campuses and cities,\n3. And regional / state / tri-state / national  groups and Discords- generally - and for categories / projects / groups at each level\n4. And maybe go ahead and start Sustainability Project Coordination Discords for other regions / states / categories to get them going, and post links on the bigger groups we're sharing around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- So we could fairly easily make similar discords for all ""sociology majors for sustainability"", ""media makers for sustainability"", ""cyclists"" for sustainability, ""investors for sustainability"", ""restaurant owners for sustainability"", ""foodies for sustainability"", ""sustainable food systems"", ""urban design / housing / landscaping / water ""  at the county, regional, state / province / tri-state.. etc. levels.\n\n\+ working groups for projects and proposals\n\n1. Including crowdfunding / investing platform / portfolios\n2. Education / training / media groups\n3. working groups for ""ultimate forum / platform / network ""\n4. Easier for organizations / cities / coordinators / media makers / educators... to see and study and help and reach and coordinate their target audience.\n5. Virtual \n   1. virtual models of projects for demonstration / peer-review / training, and proposals / crowdfunding, and city resource / project / operations management / coordination will be tremendous - \n   2. How to keep track of all the groups in the virtual worlds? How to keep all the various virtual groups and worlds connected and collaborating? - an amazing universal platform will be nice, a series of discords will be fine if we still don't have anything else."

nmg1mk,"How Digital Fashion Can Save The Environment Fast fashion is notorious for textile waste and extravagant water use. It is estimated 11 million ton of clothes are released into the environment each year. Only 10% of this is resold to charity, the rest piles up in landfills in developing countries. Around 24.56 trillion gallons of water is used for dyeing each according to the New Textiles Economy report. \n\nDigital fashion comes to the rescue by making no waste at all. There will be no fabric or water required. The making of clothes is 100% eco friendly.\n\nWhat’s more, digital fashion maintains net zero emission throughout the entire supply chain. As there's no shipping, physical usage, thrown out clothes, the amount of carbon footprint on the environment will be significantly reduced. \n\nThe only carbon footprint will come from computers used by designers to design virtual clothes. But even this is relatively small compared to traditional fashion. According to DressX, digital garments release 97% less CO2 than real pieces.\n\nMany digital fashion brands also commit to sustainability practices. For example, in 2018, Carlings donated 100% of their revenue to Water Aid. DressX also made it clear on their website to contribute 1% of its income to No More Plastic Foundation.\n\nRead more:\nhttps://www.trendblog.app/post/what-is-digital-fashion"

nmh3n0,"Anyone interested in *startups* and sustainability? In the light of recent events with Exxon, there could be massive opportunity. \nHow might we turn this recent Exxon ruling (and a company being held to account for something other than profits) into an epic opportunity to achieve sustainability? Here’s how we might do it by sparking a “startup renaissance.”  \n\nI (like many) have been thinking deeply about sustainability for almost a decade now. The not-so-obvious and glorious conclusion that I’ve arrived at is that we need a “startup renaissance” where we create startups to replace everything that is unsustainable.\n\nHere’s why. The real problem is that everything that we’ve *built* over the centuries was not built with sustainability in mind. That’s a problem, but that’s also fixable. \n\nWhen we look out on the world, the things we’ve developed (technology, tools, processes, businesses, infrastructure) are generating the negative and unsustainable consequences. These are all things that we can change at *will.* \n\nHow? We would want to create seed concepts that we can test and fund starting immediately through investments and crowdfunding. Essentially we can crowdsource a whole new society from the ground up, and actually probably become prosperous from it as a whole. By providing a wave of new investments, the investors can divest from their unsustainable companies and regular people can invest in whole new companies and features for the society. \n\nAt that point, everything becomes something we can change. It’s an opportunity to address all major problems at once and create a sustainable world for good. \n\nIs it instantaneous? No, but we can easily start small. This is an actionable plan versus the non-solutions that are currently prescribed for sustainability for which we have no real plan of action. \n\nWhat does Exxon have to do with this? Well, for the first time a corporation is being forced to be accountable for their impacts by changing how the company operates. This is big. Other companies will see this and know their time being destructive for profit is coming to an end. They’ll want to look for lower risk companies, and this “startup renaissance” can be the answer to that. \n\nAlso, destructive companies will likely enjoy the idea of this kind of democratization of the changes that need to be made.

nmj02e,"TIL how to quit your job to go fight climate change - gracefully. From Eugene Kirpichov's resignation from Google I'll be using this next month, myself:\n\n&gt;The reason I'm leaving is because the **scale, urgency and tragedy of climate change are so immense that I can no longer justify to myself working on anything else**, no matter how interesting or lucrative, until it's fixed.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I'd be lying if I didn't say that I think **others, who have the privilege of being able to do so, should follow suit**. I like to frame the problem positively as ""how much can we save"", and every one of us can have a hand in saving something.\n\n[Source](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6687859616610701312/) Eugene Kirpichov LinkedIn post, as he left Google after 7 years  to establish [WorkOnClimate.org](https://WorkOnClimate.org) \- community for people who want to work on climate long-term.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo others, it may seem like you're 'giving away' your leadership position to pursue a dream of sorts. Some find it reckless to go into a field you have no experience in. That you're giving up financial security - and for what? 'Your efforts can't move the needle,' they might claim.\n\nIn reality, you're  bringing your invaluable experience and skills into a nascent market. By nature of being nascent, most newcomers will lack industry-specific experience. And if you get in on the ground floor, the impending expansion of the field will carry you far. \n\nThere's a job that's waiting for you out there, one in which you'll get fulfillment. It won't be the last job you ever get, it won't make you more money, it probably won't check all the boxes. But you'll know that you'll be waking up every morning knowing you're helping change the world for the better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat's your 'quitting to go fix it story?"

Many big technology companies will say they are focusing towards being ""carbon neutral"". However, few of these companies care about the carbon footprint of the software they distribute. Many companies now will distribute programs based on ""[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)"", a heavy-weight engine used to distribute applications in a highly ineffective and enviromentally harmful way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), being a browser emulator essentially, is just as intensive as your average browser. If you use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) (or any [chromium](https://www.chromium.org/)\-based browser such as [Opera](https://www.opera.com/), [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge), or [Brave](https://brave.com/)), you may notice that this application uses plenty of CPU and RAM unncessisarily. [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) does something similarly as it is [chromium](https://www.chromium.org/)\-based as well. This is also coupled with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) as its back end, a generally ineffecicient implementation of the [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) language that, at its worst, can be a heavily unoptimized and an enviromentally harmful way of doing code.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo give an anecdoetal example, we can look at the popular chatting application [Discord](https://discord.com/). [Discord](https://discord.com/) runs on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and is a generally ineffective and heavy program. [Discord](https://discord.com/) can consistantly use around 10% of my CPU and over a gigabyte of my RAM during some times of usage. Compare this to a simple application like [nheko](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko) (A [QT](https://www.qt.io/)\-based chatting application for the [Matrix-protocol](https://matrix.org/)). This application isn't based on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), yet still delivers much of the same features as [Discord](https://discord.com/). I have observed [nheko](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko) to use, on average, less than 1% of the CPU and uses less RAM when compared to [Discord](https://discord.com/) while, generally speaking, offering much of the same features. This comparision is a sign [Discord](https://discord.com/) could do way better in terms of preformance while still offering quality service.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy is this a problem? Well, this has many many problems. The first is that this increases the amount of electricity people use. Since over 150 million people actively use [Discord](https://discord.com/), lets say only 5 million of those people use the Discord desktop app. If 5 million people are using a application which uses a LOT more CPU, and therefore, power, then it needs to, [Discord](https://discord.com/)'s lack of caring about the environment costs us extra electricity, electricity that wouldn't be used if [Discord](https://discord.com/) wasn't a [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) based app. Now, lets say for sake of argument that every computer running the [Discord](https://discord.com/) desktop client uses renewable, sustainable energy (they don't, but lets just say for sake of argument they do) this is STILL a huge problem for the environment. If every company distributes unoptimized, [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) based apps, people will soon notice their computers getting slower. What happens when the average person has a slow computer? They get a new one. Even experienced users who know how to upgrade a computer and get the parts they need, they are still buying new computer parts they wouldn't have needed if companies would stop making [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) based apps. That means that every company that distributes [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) based apps, the more computer parts that need to be assembled and be transported on a gas guzzling vehicle so it can go to the destination of the customer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what should we do? Well, as consumers, we should be boycotting [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) based programs, and telling the companies who distribute them that you are not happy with their laziness and greed. As programmers, they should be using frameworks that do not use [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). For example, the [QT framework](https://www.qt.io/). The [QT framework](https://www.qt.io/) is a cross platform API for making GUI based programs. [QT](https://www.qt.io/) is unlike the [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) framework, because instead of running [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) for every program, it just runs the program. If any of you actually care about the environment, you should be doing something about this."

What if there was a network that worked to create all new sustainable companies that are superior to products currently on the market (the ones that pollute and degrade our natural resources)? I'm looking for those who are passionate about sustainability to form a community that launches these sustainable products and services.  \n\n\nThere's a huge opportunity to work *within* the system that we have to create a whole new landscape of offerings that help us achieve our sustainability goals. These new offerings should be superior to what's currently polluting so that consumers make the switch easily.  \n\n\nWe can use the power of consumer demand and pure creativity to create a sustainable world.  \n\n\n1. In a creative/discussion group, we can **decide on what industries and offerings to strategically target**. This could be transportation, food... or anything else. We'll put them on our list of unsustainable products to compete against.\n2. We can then create campaigns to fund explorations and research into how to make these products more sustainable, and also superior. We can create crowdfunding campaigns to **fund tests and minimum viable sustainable products**.\n3. Once something is seen as viable we can **put it up for investment**. We, ourselves, can invest in it while attracting outside investors to expand the products and services if necessary. Essentially, profit wouldn't be the enemy in this case, it would be a nice byproduct of creating a sustainable world.\n\nThe cool thing? There's no need to quit your day job if you don't want to. Even with regular people participating in something like these we can spread the word and make progress.\n\nAnother cool thing is that we don't have to go through the arduous process of overthrowing capitalism before we start achieving sustainability. We can work within the system to transform the world by replacing outdated industries.   \n\n\nThis is an actionable plan that could get us on track. If interested send me a PM and I'll see how we can all connect."

(This isn’t an excuse just trying to give back story) \nI mainly chose to go vegan about 8 months ago in an effort to be more sustainable. Yes I still care about the animals but I also really care about reducing was including food waste. That being said I have young children who do eat some animal products. And anyone who has kids knows that kids aren’t the best at reducing waste. My thought is don’t throw the kids left overs, just eat it! \nI’m so conflicted! I am hoping to work my family into veganism too. For now my husband and kids has moved to vegetarian which I am thankful for his efforts and believing in me and supporting me. But what is the less of two evils here? Eat the food waste of the kids or toss it. (And let me say now it is SO rare that I can get them to eat left overs) thank you for the advice and insight!"

ntpapo,"Paper bags and plastic tubs... Hi all, hope this is the right subreddit to post this.\n\nI was wondering, why are more supermarkets (or any new ones) not transitioning to using paper bags and plastic, reusable tubs?\n\nI imagine a place where everything is in bulk. Dry goods like pasta and rice can be siphoned out in set quantities (500g, 1kg, etc) into tubs/jars you can either bring with you or buy in store. You can also buy recyclable paper bags which themselves are made from recycled paper. You can use these for fruits, veggies, cakes, bread, whatever. Even meat is presented in large trays and you pick as much as you want.\n\nStaff would be focussed on helping customers find what they need, or maybe handing out required amounts of meat or other goods for hygiene reasons. \n\nThere would be a few tills but it would mostly be self-service, with scannable codes on screens around the store. So if you get 1kg of rice, the 1kg code would appear and you can scan it.\n\nThe major obstacles I can see are consumer laziness, set up cost and running costs.\n\nWith traditional supermarkets still selling mostly packaged goods, likely cheaper, anyone not bothered about sustainability would just go there. Anyone trying the new store might be put off by the amount of preparation involved; unless you wanted to spend and fortune on tubs every time you shop, you'd need to plan your shop more precisely.\n\nThe tech required to make the self-service work mostly already exists and is in use by most major supermarkets but you'd essentially need to build a completely different store and develop the tech for managing the output of goods. While I don't think this would need to be too complicated, it would likely be expensive to start with.\n\nRunning a regular supermarket has overheads of course but with shops like Aldi slashing them by having goods delivered on shelf-ready pallets, our new store would have an overhead issue. How would employees get 50kg of rice into a massive bin, ready to be released in portions? They may need extra training on how to use forklifts or other machines and handling heavy goods brings with it more regulations like hazard pay.\n\nThoughts? I'm in the UK by the way so my perspective on supermarkets comes from there."

o1my9t,"What is Sustainability? A short explanation (work-in-progress) Hey there /r/sustainability. I've noticed that there are plenty of people confused about the meaning of sustainable, so i am working on a (somewhat short) explanation that will get the idea across. Comments and criticisms welcome. This is what i have so far:\n\nSustainability means that the situation is not terminal. \n\nOr in mathematical terms:\n\n## use &lt;= replacement rate\n\nIf the situation involves materials that are being used at a higher rate than they are replaced, then that situation is not sustainable.\n\nIf in the area i inhabit, 5 trees reach maturity each year, and i take less than 5 trees, then the situation is sustainable. The forest will, assuming no changes in conditions, grow or stay the same. \n\nIf I were to take more than 5 trees per year, i would slowly but surely cut down the whole forest and the forest would become less productive as it is reduced. This situation would be unsustainable.\n\nChanges in conditions factor in as well, if someone else moves in that wants to use the forests wood as well our use may grow over the replacement rate, transforming the situation from sustainable to not.\n\nWhen we talk about sustainability, the conditions must be laid out.\n\n## In what area? \n\nSustainability is a **localized** measure, if you are dependent on outside resources, then changes in outside conditions that you are unable to influence can cause your situation to become unsustainable. You could measure this at any scale, if you look at the way humans are acting on earth as a whole, the situation is entirely unsustainable, we are using the planet faster than it is being replaced. However, there may be areas where the situation is sustainable, despite being unsustainable on the whole. High resolution - smaller pieces - is a better way to judge a situation than lumping it all together (though, as the parts become sustainable, we will be moving towards a situation where we the whole is as well)\n\n## For what size population?\n\nEach place has its own **carrying capacity** - and we must include in this calculation the needs of the other life around us. This number is not fixed, it can increase or decrease based on environmental factors -  a square mile of city can support less life than a square mile of tropical rainforest. \n\nAll that said, it basically comes down to what I started with, for a situation to be called sustainable ***must*** mean it isn't terminal - it can be sustained under current conditions."

When using Google, it was difficult and time-consuming to find sustainable suppliers or manufacturers, and we were bombarded with non-sustainable options. There’s no real search engine for finding them specifically.\n\nSo we decided to build [GreenHive](https://green-hive.com/), a platform that will connect eco-minded entrepreneurs with environment-oriented suppliers, manufacturers, and consultants. The goal is to make it easy for them to source the materials, products and services which meet their sustainability and business needs. Companies are grouped according to the industry they operate in. They will have profile pages on which they display their sustainability commitments, and their products &amp; services. Here’s an [example company](https://green-hive.com/project/good-company-1/#sustainability-practices).\n\nOur current platform is still a bit simplistic, but what we envision is that when an entrepreneur has an idea, he simply types it and will receive a curation of the eco-friendly suppliers that can potentially meet his needs. We have more complex, sustainability-focused ideas in mind, but at the moment we are keeping it simple. \n\nSince a lot of people feel that companies, large or small, need to be more environmentally responsible, we are excited to share this and are curious what you think! Do let us know of any feedback, ideas, or features you’d like to see.\n\nCheers!"

I'm following different job boards centered around sustainability, but partially due to the [nature of my major](https://whatcanidowiththismajor.com/major/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/commstudies.pdf)\* as well as the American economy, I feel almost any work I'll find is bound to go against my environmentalist ideals.

It's one thing to excuse as a consumer or a worker, but if I'm active in the higher levels,  it just feels worse. \n\nREI is hiring my major, as well as organizations such as Earthjustice, and I'm looking for ways to get into the non-profit sector, but well, not going to lie- I am getting a generalist degree from a non-target school and have very little experience in professional situations. So it will take a while before I could get a 'dream job'.

o47jqp,"Companies are showing green to get the green Yo my peeps,\nA mega trend that the Economist magazine has been pointing out for several issues recently is the rampant green washing in ""ESG"" funds. Assets managers are getting creepy  about taking millenial's money eager to invest in sustainable (green) companies. They finally have something a robo-index can't do better (for now). This green investment demand is essentially incentivizing companies like Altria to hire the big four accounting firms of the world to assure or write fancy susty reports every year that the rating agencies eat up and give them a nice 'A+'. The idiot assets managers see that 'A+' and assume they are green, compare that against income statements, then reallocate. You see the problem here? Companies can show they are green, but not actually be green within the conventional theory of sustainability. A cycle that will just continue a drift to low performance. \nSo, my questions are:\n-What do you all think of this trend?\n-What public companies are actually green, or actually trying?\n-Can sustainability actually be a practical investment thesis at this point, when not even the technology or business models have transitioned?"

o5trfe,"Low carbon employment in Canada? Hi,\n\nI've got a lot of stress in my life right now... really never been so close to the street with a parent in the hospital with only a small chance they'll be leaving upright. I've also developed some ptsd from things that I've seen on dives in the ocean, but suffered a barotrauma that's ended my ability to dive. I've been riding out the pandemic working on sustainable industry but can't find any funding or don't meet the criteria to get my ideas funded, and, because I've been living with someone that's immunocompromised, I have been keeping my distance from people. I desperately want to get back to work BUT I can't be a part of this problem anymore. After seeing what I have, I can't justify my comfort at that price and would rather starve than be generating wealth by burning fossil carbon, which appears to be still the only way to generate wealth. The ocean was my first love and the one thing i let my guard down enough to love completely, only to dive into a patch of dead water on multiple coasts and now the idea of contributing to that imbalance/crime makes me physically ill. \n\nI would like to get into refrigerant/f-gas destruction or something similarly carbon negative so I can sleep at night, or work with any NGO focused on feeding the world or finding creative ways to deal with emerging problems. \n\nAs much as I want to just walk in and get paid and forget about all this stuff, something inside me is screaming ""THIS IS ALL WRONG! YOU KNOW IT'S WRONG! YOU'RE KILLING EVERYTHING, YOU HYPOCRITE!"" and I can't shut it up. I also can't understand how people are bringing children into this world even though i would have loved to have been a father... but especially, how can you bring kids into this world and not care about the climate? doesn't that ensure that your kid(s) will end up hating you for bringing them into a world on fire without a plan or even minimal effort?\n\nIs there a place for people like me in this world? I really figured that the pandemic, the hurricanes, the fires, the drought, the food insecurity, etc ad infinitum would have led to some cultural awareness that the way we've been living IS the problem we're trying to solve and that we'd be working together on figuring that problem out by now. Instead, it seems like we can't wait to get back to making everything worse and I just can't be a part of it. I want to go back to when I didn't know how bad it was, but now that I do, all I see are people gambling on the Titanic right before it hits the iceberg. What does wealth even matter when the world is on fire? Are we seriously going to pass up the opportunity to work together in order to take turns starving to death to ""protect"" our own? there isn't enough left for conflict. There's barely enough left for survival. Why are we still following money when it has led us here without a life raft or alternative?\n\ni'd work for food and shelter if we were working on something bigger, together. I don't want things, but I do need people in my life and I'm worried that I'm going to collapse entirely if I don't have a direction when the bad news comes in. I went from having a home and a community to being entirely isolated and in debt since 2019 and i feel completely broken. All I'm missing is a community of like-minded people trying to figure out how to live with this world rather than against it. I think model communities are a good way to help solve these problems before we get smacked over the head by them and I can't be alone in thinking that way.\n\nanyways, i have a background in biochemistry and medical lab science and some coding, especially embedded stuff. I'm good at growing mushrooms and other cultured foods... I'm really just looking for some new friends that don't think I'm crazy for spending as little money as possible in an oil/consumption based economy. Hell, I'd run a hostel at this point, even though the colonialism part of it makes me really uncomfortable. \n\ni dont understand any part of my world anymore or anyone in it and I'm ready to move on into something i don't need to hate myself for being a part of. \n\nthe horror, the horror..."

o6fdwk,"Little thing I wrote(is it a poem?) titled Edin’s grief I walk outside into my backyard, the soft morning sunlight greeting me with warm open arms. It is the end of spring, and the world is finished waking up. The trees are full of broad, green leaves, the grass we planted has taken root and is thriving, all sorts of ground cover litters the underbrush at the back of the fenced in yard, barely separated from the forest beyond by a chain link barrier and the human touch. I breathe in the air, and sit, listening to the birds sing, and looking at the small slice of my 4 billion year old mother, more detailed and intricate than a renaissance painting. My eyes dart around at each leaf, each glorious stroke of vibrant, living color, and yet, I do not smile. For I know that this will pass, not like the end of summer into fall, into winter as the world slumbers again, nor like the death of a small creature, a small piece of the world silently fading into the forest floor, no, no that was not the reason. I was frowning before all this life because each piece would soon leave without proper replacement, unlike all other seasons, and all other lives, the last winter would fall, and this delicate place would shatter to pieces. I would watch it crumble in my later years, my children would know it’s beauty only for a short time, and theirs none at all. I sat in front of the glorious tapestry of life, knowing that I would be one of the last to view it in all its awe, and that there was little I could do to change that."

For the last Wednesday of the month, I like to zoom out a little and reflect on our monthly topic (meat) through different lenses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday's was seriously quite rough. Here are the honorable mentions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* [**Native Tradition vs. Militant Veganism**](https://lakotalaw.org/news/2018-12-12/veganism) (An Indigenous vegan perspective on [**LakotaLaw.org**](http://lakotalaw.org/))\n* [**How America became the red meat republic**](https://civileats.com/2019/05/09/how-america-became-the-red-meat-republic/) ([**Civileats.com**](http://civileats.com/) on beef and colonialism)\n* [**Slaughterhouse Workers**](https://foodispower.org/human-labor-slavery/slaughterhouse-workers/) (Human rights abuses in the meat industry from [**Foodispower.org**](http://foodispower.org/))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reflection I actually ended up going with is from PBS: [**In Nicaragua, supplying beef comes at a high human cost.**](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/in-nicaragua-supplying-beef-to-the-u-s-comes-at-a-high-human-cost)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis 8-min video and its accompanying transcript were WILD, y'all. I shouldn't be surprised anymore after learning about how extractive capitalism is, but yet again, I'm shocked.  \n\n\n* **The problem: The Nicaraguan beef supply chain is DIRTY** 🤧 .  \n""People are dying from violent land invasions, their lands taken away for cattle ranching, cattle, which then turns into beef, which comes into United States. Yes, people are being killed.""  \n\n* **Why it matters: Nicaragua is going ham** **on its beef exports.**  \n""Nicaragua has become the third largest supplier of frozen beef to the United States. Its imports have reached an all-time high during the pandemic, doubling in just four years.""  \n\n* **How bad is it: Whole Indigenous villages are being decimated** ⚫ **.**  \nAccording to an Indigenous leader, ""In this year, we have more than 10 people in less than seven months murdered already. The settlers, them shot with a gun one girl of 14 years...to create fear.""  \n\n* **What's** **America doing: lol nothing.**  \nAccording to Republican senator Mike Rounds, ""American consumers don't have any inkling as to where their beef comes from today."" Basically, regulations are pretty wack because of how powerful the cattle industry is, and executives are turning a blind eye to literal murders in their supply chain. Sooooo, the usual, I guess.\n\nFor the past three weeks, [we've focused on the environmental impact of meat](https://www.soapboxproject.org/archive/june-2021-does-meat-eating-cause-climate-change-vegan-plant-based) and how beef is THE WORST in terms of emissions.

If you don't lift, you won't need to spend more than $2-3. \n\nI spend .50 on half an avocado a day, less than a dollar a day on supplements (the most expensive is algae oil, if you're on a budget I would just recommend fish oil instead), a dollar on almonds, then maybe $2-3 on rice/beans/quinoa. Sometimes I'll spend about $1.50 - 2 on Seitan. I am losing some weight, though, so I'll probably up my calorie content a little when I lose my excess. As it stands, that comes out to around $14 a day for a high protein diet, and $9 a day for a moderate protein diet.\n\nThe biggest loss is convenience. Most restaurants don't really offer vegan options. I don't miss the taste of meat that much, though.\n\nAs a side note: Meat-eaters who only eat chicken are also doing the planet a favor. It's much lighter on GHG emissions, and it's cheaper than steak."

o9exwn,"Veganism has absolutely nothing to do with sustainability. This sub is completely over-run with people whose agenda looks like this:\n\n1. Veganism\n2. Animal rights\n3. Veganism\n4. Veganism\n5. Veganism\n6. Veganism\n7. Veganism\n8. Animal rights\n9. Veganism\n10. Oh yes, and sustainability.\n\nSustainability is about the creation of hunan systems which are compatible with the ecosystem. For most of human history, we were hunter-gatherers who ate a meat-heavy diet. And for the whole of this time, that system was sustainable. It was compatibile with the holocene ecosystem.  Well...that's not entirely true, because there was a long-term pattern of extinction of megafauna as a result of human activity. But that's not the same as the entire ecosystem being threatened with collapse, which is what is happening now. The key to the sustainability of that system was the limitation of human numbers. Hunter-gathering just doesn't permit a large enough human population to destabilise the entire system.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason why humans cannot create a sustainable system that involves eating meat. What would make it sustainable are these two things:\n\n1. Strictly enforced limits to overall population and consumption.\n2. 100% recycling of waste products and 0% dependence on non-renewable resources.\n\nNote that there is no ""veganism"" on this list.\n\nWhat veganism would do, in *both* an optimally sustainable system *and* in our unsustainable system, is to increase the capacity of the system for human population. If everybody in the world today became a vegan the world would be not one millimetre closer to sustainability.  Similarly, if everybody living in a system meeting the two requirements above was a meat eater, but the limits were set accordingly, then it would not be one millimetre further away from sustainability.\n\ntl;dr ""increased carrying capacity"" is an entirely different thing to ""structurally sustainable."""

o9kbnr,"My job is going to in-person full-time again, and because of this I'm facing adding another metric ton of CO2 a year just from driving to work I switched jobs at the start of March 2020 so I've been remote the entire time. It's not always the easiest but it worked for over a year. Now my job decided everyone needs to be back in the office full time starting July 1st. I did back-of-the-napkin calculations and driving round trip 13 miles a day, approximately 250 work days a year, with my car's average fuel efficiency and I would need 112 gallons of gas a year just for work. At 20 pounds of CO2 per gallon, that's adding over a metric ton of emissions FOR NO GOOD REASON. Now multiply this by dozens of my co-workers (some with shorter and some with longer, but no one I know carpools or rides the bus).\n\nMy alternative is riding my bike 15 minutes to a bus stop and then taking the bus for 25 minutes, which would triple my total commute time because our city doesn't give a shit about transit riders. I'm going to give it a shot to see if I can handle it at least a few days a week.\n\nWe desperately need to normalize remote work and massively expand and destigmatize riding the bus and biking to work. This also got me thinking about how more democratically controlled workplaces would help too. If the workers were unionized or the firm was a co-op, we could vote or tell our management that we want to stay remote or do hybrid work - but we have no power in this system."

o9ksgs,"VEGANISM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SUSTAINABILITY. HERE COMES THE TRUTH AGAIN YOU USELESS WANKERS. Imagine two parallel worlds that branched from our own 1000 years ago.\n\nIn one of these - let's call it ""Limitworld"", the people in charge decided (rather like the Chinese in the 1980s) to set absolute limits to the population and to consumption levels. They make it sacrosanct law that the human population must never exceed 1 billion, and also that nobody can be permitted to become super-rich and vastly overconsume as an individual. In the other - ""Veganworld"" - the people in charge decided (more like the Indians) that everybody must be vegan. They make it illegal and culturally unacceptable for anybody to eat animal products.\n\nWhat do you think would happen in these two parallel worlds? The answer could not be clearer.\n\nIn Limitworld there will either be no ecological collapse at all, or it will happen much more slowly and be much easier to fix. Limitworld at least has a decent shot at genuine sustainability. Meanwhile, in Veganworld, the human population level would already be considerably higher than in our own world. That would be because the vegan system of food production permitted considerably more people, globally, to be alive at one time before significant numbers start dying of starvation. Veganworld, therefore, isn't even as sustainable as our own world. They would literally be in even more trouble than us, because those extra couple of billion people will still need somewhere to live, still need to use transport, etc...\n\nI respectfully ask that you deal with the actual point I am making, and do not try to further derail this discussion with counter-arguments that do not affect this one.\n\nLimiting population and consumption doesn't merely ""contribute"" to sustainability. It's the single most critical factor. Without it, there can be no sustainability. Veganism, on the other hand, doesn't contribute at all. A vegan world with no limits would be less, not more, sustainable than our own.."

We just launched about a week and a half ago: [www.talkclimatechange.org](http://www.talkclimatechange.org/)\n\nWe started this campaign because we are frustrated that speaking with others about climate change is too often forgotten as a powerful individual climate action. As climate scientist Michael Mann writes in his book The New Climate War, ""silence breeds inaction"". Conversations are the gateway to climate solutions because they help build social and political support among the public for climate action.\n\nHere's [how our campaign works](https://talkclimatechange.org/how): \n\n1. Have an open conversation with a family member, friend, neighbor, coworker, or literally anyone about anything related to climate change \n2. [Submit](https://talkclimatechange.org/form) a few details about your conversation to our website, including a message to COP26\n3. We will add it to our [global conversation map](https://talkclimatechange.org/map) and share your submissions at COP26\n\nYou can create an account on our site to revisit and keep track of all your conversations. Our website also provides some [advice and guidance](https://talkclimatechange.org/advice) on how to have an effective discussion.\n\nWe are happy to answer any questions and greatly appreciate your help getting the word out!

oaj8va,"What makes food sustainable or unsustainable? There are a variety of aspects of sustainable food that I'm aware of, some easier to track than others. The two big ones seem to be GHG emissions for that food and the amount of water used by that food. Water use is relatively easy to track, you can Google how much water goes into a gram of a certain food item. Meat is a little trickier because you have to account for the animal's water use as well as the water use for its feed. Information on GHG emissions by animal is relatively easy to research, but nitrous oxide emissions by fertilizer use for plant agriculture seems harder. Transportation also seems important. If you buy local, you are contributing to less GHG emissions by vehicle use. People have also voiced that whether a food is processed or not contributes to its sustainability, but other than increased transportation and GHG emissions by the lab used to process the food I don't understand how that makes it less sustainable. Anyways, would anyone like to share any additional information about what makes food sustainable or unsustainable, and how they personally research to reach conclusions about the best types of food to eat?"

I do not know these people, and I'm not looking at pictures of the dead, so it doesn't change my emotional state. Seeing a picture of someone starving in Africa makes me feel bad, but the thought doesn't stay with me very long after seeing the picture.

ocd0aj,"How to be more sustainable... from someone who works in retail I currently work in a large supermarket in the UK, so this list won't be applicable to everyone, and some points are pretty basic, but hopefully it will be of use to some people :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **There is SO.MUCH.FOOD.WASTE** \- if you can, buy single banana's (as these always get left and thrown out) and buy shorter dated food (good for if you're going to freeze/eat that day anyway). Also any produce with a bump/bruise/doesn't look pretty often gets thrown out. Before I worked in retail I kind of assumed all the food gets sold or the employees get to take it home if it's still fine but technically out of date... but nope. Honestly some days I wonder how we make a profit. Unfortunately most of my colleagues don't rotate stock properly and this is contributing to the issue. I also see a lot of stock arrive in store damaged as it hasn't been properly packaged. \n* **Buy items/food with damaged packaging** \- anything whereby a seal etc is compromised shouldn't be on the shelf, but I see lots of items with a slight cosmetic damage to the packaging sit on the shelf for months and eventually thrown away. I've seen people in need of a specific item, and choose not to buy it because there's only 3 left in a slightly crumpled cardboard box. In my store we offer a small discount for such damage, but items are still largely unsold. \n* **If you decide you don't want a chilled/frozen item you've picked up, put it back in a fridge/freezer.** So many people just leave chilled items on a shelf and then we have to throw it away. \n* **Shelf packaging can be deceiving** \- my store sells toilet rolls in paper wrap... that arrive in store COVERED in plastic wrap. We sell glass bottles that arrive in boxes with protective plastic inserts. It might be worth asking store staff how a product arrives in store in order to make an informed choice as to which is the more sustainable packaging option. (Of course package-free is always best, but not accessible to everyone).\n* **Research how to properly store food at home** \- sometimes storing things it's original packaging isn't best (e.g. I always put a papertowel in with my salad, and if it's compacted into a bag I separate it into 2 containers). \n* **Buy loose produce** \- for lots of things this often works out a little cheaper too. In my store we sell 3 onions in a net bag for around 60p, buying them loose is around 40p.\n* **Bring re-usable carrier bags/produce bags** \- I personally don't use produce bags, I just pop items straight into my trolley and then later into a carrier bag. The amount of people I see with a single onion in a plastic bag utterly baffles me. \n* **Avoid using the produce weighing machines that produce a barcode sticker** \- just weigh produce on a self-serve check-out, or a manned check-out and there's no need for a sticker. \n* **Try to avoid returning items that cannot be resold** \- in a clothes shop I worked at previously, we would accept underwear returns, but even if the packaging was sealed/hygiene strips intact, we had to send it off to be destroyed. \n* **Try not to 'dirty' clothes when trying them on in-store** \- again, in the clothes shop I worked at, we often had dresses and tops with foundation stains around the neck, and even with a discount these items would largely remain unsold.\n\nOf course buying local/second hand/direct from the producer or farmer and package-free is better :)"

ocd7ym,"On the quality crisis in this sub, and how to address it I am calling for cultural and systemic change in this community.  \n\n\nLet's start from the problem: I am tired of witnessing the prominence of inflammatory rants, low-information posts, simplistic slogans, unsubstantiated discussions and cliché memes in this subreddit. I know that I am not alone. More important than our being irritated, I submit that **currently, the time and energy of readers and writers here are hugely wasted, when we sorely need them to be applied constructively** (and that would make us happier, too)**.** In other words, r/sustainability lives well below its potential. As things are, the visible discussions here have lower average quality than a at political party convention.  \n\n\nMost of it is either common sense or Reddiquette, but let's recall some **guidelines for sane content:**\n\n1. **Don't upvote just because you agree.** Upvoting is for boosting visibility: it is meant to assert that in the current context, this piece of content likely merits one of the very few slots in the reader's attention span. The intention behind upvoting should be *""this enriches the discussion and is worth your time""*, not *""YEEEAAAAAAH PREAAAACH!!!!""*.\n2. Corollary: **don't upvote unconstructive posts,** even if they resonate. When people mindlessly amplify the messages that resonate, it's called an echo chamber.\n3. **Don't downvote just because you disagree.** Downvoting is silencing: it's sometimes warranted, but it's exclusive, and should be a last-resort measure against unequivocally inappropriate content. Downvoting means *""this doesn't belong here""*, not *""I disagree""*. If you disagree about a something, write a comment challenging it, or upvote one.\n4. **Refrain from writing knee-jerk reactions.** We can always do better.\n5. **Think twice before posting.** Take the Stoics' advice: ""isn't it better left unsaid?"". Regarding the contents posted here, we would all be much better off with **more quality, less quantity.** *(Oh hey, look at that, we have the same advice for material consumption, isn't that beautiful?)*.\n6. **Don't express yourself violently.** It's not useful here.\n7. **Substantiate your arguments.** Take the time to write thoughtfully, and provide verifiable evidence when possible.\n\nA well-functioning online forum does not look like a choir or an arena. It's a high-conductivity social network for conveying knowledge, empathy and ideas.\n\nI've been talking about avoiding the promotion of bad content. So what should we promote instead? Well, as I said, there's no reason to aim for today's throughput of publication. Still, here are some ideas:\n\n1. **Insightful, solid, methodical information** describing sustainability-related issues or shedding light on how to address them.\n2. Co-creating corpora of **communication materials for activism**, as well as **plans for transitioning towards sustainability.**\n3. Sharing **practical advice** for sustainability at an individual level.\n4. **Political debates,** aimed at achieving consensus on a hierarchy of needs and desirable actions.\n5. **Training for political debates** outside of this community.\n6. Non-violent sharing of **feelings and emotional support.** (Preferably condensed in a few dedicated threads, please).\n7. Organizing **study groups**.\n\n**Note to moderators:** maybe some of these guidelines and recommendations belong in the community rules sidebar?\n\n  \nOne could argue that I'm being elitist here, and that if I'm not happy I can join or create some other community that has higher standards. I see 2 reasons why this doesn't hold. First, it's not elitist to call for thoughtful discussion - if you ask me, suggesting it's elitist is underestimating people's potential for thoughtful discussion. Second, by its very name, r/sustainability claims to be *the* subreddit for sustainability, and that position comes with certain responsibilities. Si I submit that it's the other way around: **when people just need to vent off (which they legitimately do), they should do it somewhere else** (e.g in r/sustainbilityVentingOff).  \n\n\nI sympathize with the suffering and human traits that have led to the behaviours I'm criticizing, and I hope it's clear that **I blame nobody in this community**. I'm not excluding myself from this criticism. I hope this post will contribute to improving things. It is demanding, I know, but that's out of respect for people's time, and because the stakes are high.  \n\n\nCan we agree to that?"

Let me explain a bit why:\n\nI usually use shaving foam for comfort (the one in alluminium tubes), an electric rasor to get most of the 3 and a half hairs away, and the finishing touch with some disposable razor (booh!), afterward, depending on how much I butchered my face, I use some aftershave.\n\nNow, my problems are as that I'm softskinned, inexperienced in shaving and clumsy. So I don't think I could get rid of the shaving foam (it stings to not use it :( ), but I could totally go for a more sustainable product that would hold the same purpose, I am bad at shaving as a whole, and for now I can't get close shaved without a disposable blade (I'm working on that) and I don't intend to use a barber's razor as I would 100% hurt myself by accident with it, and I don't intend to test the quality of the emergency service at the hospital.\n\nSo if you have any good advice on shaving sustainabily (or shaving as a whole.

(please consider supporting at the link!)\n\ntldr: scaling regenerative biointensive gardens through crop museums (chemical free, all organics) using recycled materials \n\nI am a graduate student -- with a love of biodiversity and permaculture -- working at IIRR, a Philippines-based NGO at the forefront of regenerative and agroecological approaches since the 1990s.\n\nOver decades, IIRR has accumulated a collection of such indigenous crops and cultivars which has been maintained (in vivo) in the 3,500 sqm campus “crop museum” with 52 types of vegetables with 183 varieties; 15 kinds of fruit trees with 21 varieties; and 8 types of herbs with 9 varieties.\n\nUsing the genetic resources grown in the crop museum, IIRR has worked with communities to establish additional crop museums (200-square-meters each) at 300 schools strategically located across the Philippines to conserve agrobiodiversity of native plants, educate the youth on science and ecology through gardening, boost nutrition with healthy indigenous crops, and strengthen community food systems. This is accomplished through crop museums serving as learning hubs, action-research sites, and seed propagation centers for the generation of seeds for native plants to be distributed freely to school and community gardens.\n\nWe had a few grants to do this work in the past, but the pandemic has made financing hard to come by. We are running a [crowdfunding initiative to help build more crop museums](https://fundrazr.com/cropmuseum) to protect agrobiodiversity in a country that has been heavily affected by over-introduction and importation of new varieties for commercial planting.

ofqspv,"Questions about plant-based leather Really surprised by how many responses I got for the first post 😀 Related to the pineapple leather that Nike used, I am curious to know if there are any material experts that can provide more insights on plant-based leather? \n\nMy understanding is that traditional vegan leather are mostly pvc-based which creates plastic pollution problems. So the latest trend is plant-based leather. Like the mushroom leather that Hermès experimented with. There are also many small, boutique brands like apple leather by Allégorie and cactus leather by Desserto (this one is actually huge now and I have seen it every where). Are these plant-based materials actually sustainable, better than pvc-based leather, and compare to recycled plastic materials? \n\nMany thanks!"

I don't know a great deal about NFT's, blockchain technology and REC's and I would like to learn more.** \n\nIn ESG investing, there is the difficulty in assuring the validity of the ESG-actions claims of an organization. The difficulty in verification leads to something called greenwashing. Greenwashing is when a company claims a practice they employ is environmentally friendly or beneficial when it is not. The claims are intentionally misleading, generally so the organization can escape shifting revenues towards a carbon neutral/negative mission. \n\n To phrase as a question: ""Is this organization actually using energy produced by sustainable methods, therefore contributing to the global effort to transition away from energy produced by fossil fuels? Or are they claiming to do this only to maintain/increase its sustainability rating thus improving it's ROI to investors?""\n\nOrganizations need power. Power is created by several different power generating facilities and then stored/distributed through the grid. All of the power in the grid is mixed together. There is no way as of right now to verify whether the power in the grid has been generated by coal based power plants or by a wind farm. \n\nOrganizations will purchase this power and then also buy RECs (renewable energy certificates) which grants them the right to say they purchased sustainably produced electricity. In actuality, they have not purchased electricity that is any different than what you or I or any other organization, without the REC's have purchased. It is the same electricity, from the grid, all mixed together. An organization that purchases REC's and then uses power from the grid, to increase its sustainability rating, is engaging in a process called greenwashing. \n\nThis is where the introduction of NFT's can can be useful to verification of grid-obtained energy. An NFT or non-fungible token is a unique identifier for something either tangible or intangible. NFT's are traceable and verifiable because they are built on blockchain technology (a distributed public ledger). If an NFT was assigned to the electricity produced from a wind farm, an organization could then purchase that energy and also purchase a linked NFT in the form of a REC and verify the legitimacy of the source of their energy. This use of NFTs as RECs can help mitigate the act of greenwashing in organizations."

I’ve had it for a while and it got me through my bachelors but it’s been on the decline for over a year now to the point where it’s not useable. My tech friends say that this is inevitable with laptops as they get older and it’s not something that can be fixed. I’m head back to school in the fall and will need a working computer. What is the most sustainable way to go about this? Is it best to buy used or refurbished or best to buy something newer for the longevity? Are there any laptops made with sustainability in mind and aren’t all into planned obsolescence?\n\nI’m open to any suggestions or advice since I don’t know much about tech"

Does it make more sense to buy it direct from the country of manufucture, or would it be better to buy it from a ""local"" warehouse? \n\nMy thinking, is that when it is shipped overseas to the ""local"" warehouse, it is bulk packaged, and therefore less wasteful.

okjl1i,"Food Waste Discrimination &amp; Planned Obsolescence The 2019 hunger index ranked India 102 out of 117 qualifying countries. India scored 30.3 which means India suffers from a serious hunger problem. According to UN estimates 40% of all food produced in India is either lost or wasted. 69% of all deaths of children under the age of five is caused by malnutrition.  \n\nFinish what on your plate, there are people dying of hunger in our country because they don’t get one nourishing square meal a day! Those are the spoken words of my mother that I got to hear when I was a child trying hard to finish what’s on plate at the dinner table. \n\nI can keep stating facts that any one of you can verify by doing a simple search on google. Better, to get a full visual and emotional impact of how grave this problem is, you can choose to visit one of the many urban slums or take a drive to poorer parts of rural India to experience the state of affairs first hand.\n\nFood is wasted in numerous ways, some of which is not directly under our control, but some definitely is. Here are some of the ways in which households and individuals can drastically reduce the amount of food they waste.  \n\nFood Discrimination: Yes, food discrimination is real and it’s a consumer driven problem. The demand for perfect looking fruits and vegetables from consumers is a major cause as to why supermarkets &amp; neighborhood stores reject produce with slight deformities or blemishes, even though the produce is perfect for consumption. This is what we call the Halo effect, which is a form of cognitive bias. He is handsome, hence he must be smart, she is beautiful thus she must be super confident, this Apple has blemishes on it, hence it is not fit for consumption. \n\nAs consumers we need to start making educated decisions by consciously bypassing this cognitive bias of ours and remember that the produce is being bought for consumption (unless you have other plans) and a few blemishes, some deformities will not make it any less nourishing than perfect looking produce. In fact, in many cases over ripe fruits are better for your health as is the case with Bananas. You must also be aware that many fruits and vegetables being sold in the market that look perfect have been made to do so through coercive and harmful means. An apt example of such a practice is polishing apples, colouring strawberries &amp; dipping ginger in acid too remove blemishes. Not much different than photo shopping your picture. \n\nPlanned Obsolescence: The definition of planned obsolescence is “In economics and industrial design, planned obsolescence is a policy of planning or designing a product with an artificially limited useful life, so that it becomes obsolete after a certain period of time.” This is evident specially in electronic goods like TV’s, cell phones, computers and is also rampant in the fashion industry as evident with ever changing styles and the massive growth of fast fashion at large. But the same concept is also applicable to the packaged food industry. Best before dates are really meant to tell you when the food tastes best, not when it will go bad. Baby food is the only product where you need to pay attention to expiry dates. Here is a list of food products that you can consume post their expiry dates as long as you follow the following precautions: \n\n1.     Cake mix: Can be used four to five months post expiry dates as long as you store it in a cool and dry place. \n\n2.     Milk: Can last fifty percent longer than the date of expiry mentioned on the packet or carton if it is stored at a colder temperature at the back of the fridge, as compared to the front where the door is constantly opened and closed. If it’s pasteurized it can last even longer. As long as it does not smell, it’s good to consume.   \n\n3.     Honey: The look of honey may change over time, but it does not really spoil. Store honey in its original jar or bottle and do not store it in a dark place or pantry. If it crystallises, just run it under some hot water or put in a bowl of hot water and it will take its original form and colour. \n\n4.     Canned goods: Food packaged in cans generally have a shelf like of about three years, but can be consumed for up to four years post the expiry date. Store canned goods in a cool dry spot. If you see dents, leakage or rusting it’s time to get dispose them. \n\n5.     Hard Cheese: Cheddar and parmesan is good to consume almost a month past its expiry date. If you see mould forming on part of the cheese, simply cut it out and use the good portion \n\n6.     Eggs: Expiry dates on the egg cartons don’t always reveal the truth and most of us end up denying ourselves a perfectly edible omelette! Here how you check if the egg can still be consumed without cracking it open. Simply place it in bowl of water to check it buoyancy. If it sinks, it’s still good to eat and if it floats chuck it in your composter. \n\n7.     Bread: The expiry date mentioned on breads is assuming that you are storing it on your counter. This date can be extended by upwards of two weeks by storing it in your fridge or freezer. As long as you don’t see mould growing on it’s safe to consume. \n\n8.     Butter: The best before date on butter is applicable once you have thawed it. Want to make your butter last longer, simple keep it in your freezer. \n\n9.     Yogurt: If unopened, yogurt is safe to eat up to one week past its expiry date if stored in your fridge soon after purchasing it. Yogurt can also be frozen for upwards of two months. Excess water on the top and curdling at the bottom means that the yogurt is past its prime and it’s time to dispose of it. \n\n10.  Dry Pasta: Generally has a shelf like of two years, but can easily be consumed one year post its expiry date. \n\n11.  Frozen Food: frozen fruits &amp; vegetables are good to consume past their expiry date. They might get freezer burn and may not be as good tasting, but they are good to consume. \n\n12.  Cookies crackers &amp; chips: These items may taste stale, but as long as they don’t smell funny they are good to consume. For cookies as long as they don’t smell funny, are kept in air tight containers and don’t crumble in your hands easily, they can still be consumed. Make sure that they don’t smell funny! \n\n13.  Chocolate: Can last up wards of eight months post its expiry date depending on how it’s been stored. Store them in a tightly sealed container in the fridge or you can store it in your freezer in an air tight container for almost two years. Fat or sugar bloom, the spotty look on your chocolate is not mould, the chocolate can still be consumed (may not taste as good) or used for baking.\n\n14.  Ketchup &amp; Mustard: Unopened ketchup can be consumed up to one year past it’s date of expiry and once opened if stored in the fridge can be consumed within six months. Mustard on the other hand can be stored for two years up Un opened past its expiry date or one year past its expiry date if open and stored in the fridge. \n\n15.  Cereal: Cereal is ok to consume almost six months post its expiry date, as long as you are ok with consume stale tasting cereal and put your sustainability commitment to test. \n\nThe important thing to remember here is that composting is the last option, only to be utilised to recycle post-consumer food waste. The goal should be to reduce wastage through a process of informed consumption and purchase decision making. Hopefully this article has shed light on how planned obsolesce and food discrimination are a major cause of food wastage and individual choices that you can make today for a better tomorrow. \n\nHere are some great resources to learn more about this subject: \n\n1.     Food Network\n\n2.     Food Loss + Waste Protocol\n\n3.     World Resource Institute \n\nWill meet you again via your Inbox next week, until then have a fabulously sustainable and happy weekend! \n\nManik Thapar\n\nEco Wise Waste Management Pvt Ltd"

onl2cu,"Serious discussion question: how to square the need for cleaner, greener technology and infrastructure with the mining and oil required to deliver that? As the title says really. Interested to hear all sides of the debate.\n\nWe all want cleaner tech, higher efficiency, less waste and made from new materials, and build a better future for poorer peoples in the world... but the materials to build those inevitably have to come from the resource industries. And yet people are very anti-oil and anti-mining but that makes no sense to me. We need those industries. So why would we force them out of our own countries just to have the job done even less sustainably and with poorer enviro protection abroad?\n\nMy grandfather used to say: \n\n""Anything that we can't grow in a field or catch in the sea has to be taken from the Earth."" \n\nAnd then he would point around the room and ask: ""Does that come from a tree, or a field? Does that?..."" Usually the answer for interesting stuff was no.\n\nI remind myself about that a lot looking through this sub, which I love by the way. The truth is that nobody is going to rip the wiring out of their own home and recycle it just to build 1/10th of an electric car. So why don't we look at the full production line, the whole picture and try to fix what's wrong with these industries rather than forcing them out to make it someone else's problem?

ony36x,"What are some ways to eat meat more sustainably I started my journey into sustainability a few years ago and I'm now considering going vegan (I already don't eat dairy products and eggs). I'm the main cook in the household, so I talked about it with my partner and while he's supportive of my decision he isn't quite ready for this step yet. Since I tend to do the shopping for us, I would like to at least try and make his meat consumption a little bit more sustainable without forcing him into choices he's not ready to make.\n\nHere's some alternatives that I could think about:\n\n-Lab grown meat: I know it exists but I couldn't find much about it. I expect it to be hella expensive and hard to find so it's probably a no go.\n-Game meat: still expensive but definitely easier to find, plus my SO loves it. While it still involves killing animals it eliminates the ethical and sustainability problems of intensive farming. I'm aware that if this was done on a large scale it would immediately stop being sustainable so I'm not sure about it.\n-Buying from small farmers: possibly the cheapest but least sustainable option, but I guess making sure that the animals are farmed correctly is at least a good starting point. And at least I wouldn't be giving my money to a multinational corporation. This step is possibly the only one that would work with eggs and dairy too.\n\nI honestly never thought much about it and I'm not really an expert in the field, so I would really appreciate appreciate some input. If this information can help, we live in central Europe."

Every day there were talks hosted from 9-5 on the amazing and beautiful @selgarsmill site. Talks covered everything from housing co-ops and saving queer venues to can the new economy be populist and even conscious rap! This was followed by live music, drag shows, campfires and more with local, sustainable food to go round every day. 🤝🥗\n\nWe learned so much and met so many inspiring people. Building a co-operative economy won’t be easy but we know it’s possible and by learning about community wealth building, community led decision making and centring our economy around the most marginalised, we can build a fairer world for everyone. 🏡🌍\n\nI hope you have been inspired to help build a progressive co-operative economy around the  U.K. and in your community.

We're building a reusable food packaging system, and I like to get your thoughts.\n\nCurrently we're all over Germany, and starting to enter Austria and France.  \nHere's how it works:  \n1. you order food in the app or directly at a partner restaurant  \n2. the restaurant packs your food in reusable containers  \n3. the restaurants scans QR codes on the containers and in your app to transfer ownership of the containers to you  \n4. Enjoy your food. You have 14 days to bring back the containers to ANY partner (where container QR codes are scanned and ownership is transferred to the partner)  \n5. If containers are not returned within 14 days, you must buy them.\n\nOur competition all have adopted a deposit system. We think our no-deposit system is better for two main reasons:  \n\- there is no upfront cost for the customer  \n\- it incentivizes users to bring back containers to avoid ""late fees"". This plays with our psychology that we prefer to do extra work to avoid a future expense, rather than do extra work to get refund on a past expense.\n\nWhat are you thoughts? What are some considerations you'd have before starting to use a reusable food packaging system (cost, hygiene, convenience, ...)\n\nI really appreciate your input! If you read down this far, here's a discount code you can use:  [https://vytal.app.link/samuel-3](https://vytal.app.link/samuel-3) (or use code **SAMUEL-3**).

opch44,"If one was to start an environmental corporation Asking for your opinion on feasibility/opportunities:\n\nI've been playing with idea of starting an company focused on environmental services. Most conservation and sustainability efforts are government and organisational efforts that seem to have little impact and are slow to be acted upon. And corporations are generally money-making machines that run more efficiently.\n\nIf there was a company that aimed at creating jobs in conservation/sustainability, with services like replantation, reclamation of degraded land (perhaps even the oceans), the revenue could be funneled back into protecting the earth and any growth for the company would mean increased conservation efforts. It's like a twist on private conservation effort that could include indigenous people, create green jobs and ultimately create a better earth. \n\nHowever, there are a few key points that need to be addressed:\n\n1. Revenue: how would it generate income? \nThe land by itself would not generate any income. One could implement sustainable farming practices, create private protected areas that are accessible to the public for a fee. The land would thus increase in value over time, but such a venture would probably be a loss-generating initiative. \nThere are government contracts that tender conservation projects, which could be a source of income. However, these are generally solicited by the government and will not necessarily be asking to provide the same services as the company.\n\n\n2. Investment: who would invest and how much?\nIf the company got started and went on to have an IPO, it is hopeful that it will raise quite a bit of money. I think people would be willing to invest in 'green stocks' and see it go up in value. However, I think it will mostly generate loss and there won't be much dividends paid out to investors. Still, there are billion-dollar companies that basically don't make profit, so as long as the company exists, it could continue doing what it does.\n\n---\nI still have some ideas on how it might turn out, but these are the main concerns. Just wanted to as everyone their thoughts on such a venture."

opfd24,"If recycling is a scam, then what should I do? *Before we begin, I should make clear that I'm not US-based. Sorry for the eventual mistakes, hope I can communicate well regardless.*  \n**\*TL;DR AT THE END.**\n\nSo... first things first. since earlier this year, I have been consuming more and more information about climate change, sustainability, these important kind of things - and it has led me to be more environment-conscious than ever.   \nThing is: I live in a rather dysfunctional home. I'm 22, and (unfortunately!) still live with my parents, who are... how should I say... *less than fun* to live with. They are very difficult people for a whole lot of reasons, but I'll stick to the earth-damaging bit here. \n\n**MOTHER**  \nMy mother is freaky about cleaning everything all the time to the point that it often becomes unhealthy. Almost like by consequence, she also waste very, VERY much paper and plastic. And a lot more things, to be sincere.  \nWith ""VERY"" I mean: every time she wash her hands she dries it up with paper towel. Every time she drinks water she uses a new disposable plastic cup. Every time she comes home she puts her used clothes in a plastic bag... I could go on and on. She truly is a waste machine.   \nMom is also one of the most arrogant beings that I've ever met — so you know that ""trying to talk her out of it"" is not an option. In fact, I've been there, tried that, was involved in major family ~~havoc~~ conflicts, gave up. Well, using disposable itens is apparently very important for her to feel clean. \n\n**FATHER**  \nI also live with my father, who is (and has always been) a very permissive man. He longs for peace and silence, Mom is very angry, stressed and loud all the time. This situation led him to do everything in his power to keep balance and avoid conflict. Since I was a kid, he's always instructed me to do the same. It means, among **a lot** of other things, that he also does that kind of wasteful things for her. Including things like letting a alcohol-wet paper towel near things, so she knows that the item has already been cleaned up. x)  \nRecently, he became worse. Dad is very prone to any kind of conspiracy, and, in the last couple months, he's been watching videos of a ""professor"" who is — brace yourself! — openly ANTI-SUSTAINABILITY. yes, that man says that ""the lie of sustainability"" will end humanity, that it is a government-communist-globalist project of power/control... well, I don't know details, but I guess you got the point already.  \nSo, problem is: he was already damaging BEFORE he was watching those kind of things, and now he is almost porpusefully wasteful. In fact, he even keeps me from being openly ecofriendly.  \nAlthough he's very different from Mom, he's also very pedant and arrogant in his own way, so trying to talk him out of it is also a no-no. \n\n**WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO**  \nAt this point, you may have guessed that I'm considering moving out as soon as it becomes financially possible for me, which, sadly, can take some time. I need to save around \~$20,000 to safely move out, and it is a LOT of money to reach around here! Oof!  \nWell, truth is that I'll have to stick in here for some more time  — becaus of it, I've been thinking about adopting a harm-reduction-policy. I won't be able to switch to full zero-waste for as long as I'm at my parents, but I'll try to do what I can (without getting involved in any more fights, I hope).  \nSilently using specific cloths for what they love to use paper towels; try to buy things only if strictly necessary and at the highest volume possible, so I can avoid financing more plastic packages; separating the trash so I can send to recycle centers... what, wait. RECYLING IS A SCAM?? WHAT DO I DO, THEN?!  \nI really want to do my part. I'm sure that when I move out I'll be able to be anything that I want, including the ecofriendly independent pretty woman I've wanted to be for so long, but... while I'm here, what the heck should I do (or not do)? I'm looking for little things that I can discreetly incorporate in my routines that should reduce impact — without it being an empty work.  \nThis piece of information about recycling really made me lose perspective on what I should focus on while I'm on this damage-management regimen.   \n\n\n**\*TL;DR:**  I've read that recycling is a scam and I'm not sure on what can I do then. My parents are anti-enviromentalists and keep me from living sustainably. I need input about what can I do to reduce environmental harm when I'm in a situation where I can do almost nothing.   \n\n\n*Disclaimer: please, don't suggest anything in the lines of ""confront them! be courageous!"".*   \n*It may be a weakness of mine, but at the moment I really don't have the mental and physical health to do that anymore. It is always more than stressful and it has never have never been worth it. I'm not in my best self right now, so, I'll try to reduce damage in this part of my life too.*"

If we continue making new substances and materials and machines, can we ultimately do good for the Earth and her living things? Or will more science just lead to different man-made horrors? Looking at the trajectory of exploitation, destruction, misery, and pollution humans have wrought, it just doesn’t seem possible that our species will ultimately be a beneficial one to our planetary ecosystem.

The IPCC (AR5, WGIII) [Summary for Policymakers](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf) states with ""high confidence"" that tax-based policies are effective at decoupling GHG emissions from GDP (see p. 28).

Everyone says to thrift or buy secondhand. \n\nHowever, all the clothes I can find in thrift stores are.... ugly. Lol. And I've seen people do some thrift flips or pair a top I would have thought was ugly in a particular way with the rest of their outfit so that it looks really cute, but I have a terrible eye for that type of thing. Or they're able to take old ""out of date"" clothes and either alter them or wear them in such a way that they look more modern. \n\n One thing that's so alluring about clothing stores or fast fashion stores for me is the way they set up mannequins and the employees wear the clothes, so you can see pieces being utilized and know what looks good together. \n\nOn top of that, it takes a million years to thrift because you basically have to spend forever sifting through clothes until you find something you like that would actually fit. \n\nSo, for someone who doesn't have a great eye and doesn't like to spend a long time shopping, what are your tips? or are there any sellers online you know of who upcycle clothes in a cute way that I can support?"

I looked around and couldn’t find a brand that resonated with me that was made locally ,eco friendly and affordable so I created BBcierva. Inspired by angels around the world, BBcierva was created to provide beautiful pieces for angels who seek ethical swimwear while still being affordable.\n\nBB was inspired by a multitude of influences. Common themes that support bb are sustainability, nature, spirituality, space and science.\n\nThe collections feature designs that are hand crafted for the perfect fit, and colours that will inspire positivity. Each bikini is handmade by me in the UK and each season captures a theme of colours, that relate to specific ideas. The first season features shades of blue and were named after the the lost city/continent of Atlantis, Lemuria and the flying island Laputa.\n\n**Sustainability** 💧🌍\n\n8 million tonnes of waste are discarded in our oceans &amp; 640 thousand tons of fishing nets are abandoned at the bottom of the ocean EVERY YEAR.\n\nBBcierva is committed to working with high end recycled fabrics made from ECONYL: a 100% regenerated nylon yarn derived from discarded fishing nets and other textile waste. This fabric can be recycled infinitely without losing quality, supporting a circular fashion industry. Using regenerated nylon also helps to clean the seas where entanglement in abandoned nets causes the deaths of many thousands of whales, dolphins and other marine life every year.\n\n**Packaging:**\n\nBB is also dedicated to recycled and biodegradable packaging. Each step of packaging the bikinis has been carefully chosen to ensure sustainability.\n\n* The grey postal bags with your address on are made from recycled polythene, which can be recycled after use.\n* The ribbon wrapped around the box is produced using waste clear PET plastic bottles, this process eliminates the creation of virgin yarn, meaning there is no oil extracted from the ground. Also 20% of the energy used in the production process is solar powered &amp; 90% of the water used is recycled in the manufacturing process.\n* The boxes are made from 77% recycled kraft materials and is fully recyclable.\n* The tissue paper is recycled, PH neutral, resists running, bleeding and fading &amp; made from 99% recycled pulp fibres. 35% of the electricity used to make this product is produced from renewable sources.\n* The bag the bikini is placed inside are recycled 50 micron polythene bags, made from 100% polyethylene virgin waste.\n* The swing tags with the BBcierva logo on are made from 350gsm recycled card.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this, and follow on insta [www.instagram.com/bbcierva](https://www.instagram.com/bbcierva/?hl=en)"

Turns out they're invasive 😒 🍁 Like so many other things with sustainability, the frustration is real when you think you're doing good but later realize it was completely worthless - or worse (see: wishcycling).\nSee this as a PSA or a discussion (has this ever happened to you??), but I just wanted to share my realization that it's really hard to plant new trees on the cheap in my neighborhood because it's dominated by two invasive trees: the sycamore maple and Norway maple.\n\nNow of course you can always go to a garden store and buy a tree but at ~$100 a pop, it's not the most economical move (not to mention transportability!). (Or buy a tiny seedling online for cheap and hope for the best...) But I'm in no rush and happen to enjoy propagating or growing plants from seeds and seedlings and I was excited to have these various seedlings appear in my yard so I could raise them, but months later, I had the bright idea to try to identify the exact types of maples these were and lo, they turned out to be the invasive sycamore maple (totally explains why they are so plentiful). And then I did it again with a different maple months later! Mistaking what I thought was a ""normal"" maple (native sugar maple) with the eerily similar Norway maple 😓\n\nLesson learned: don't wait so long to identify trees in your neighborhood and that you're trying to plant - and also, your local ecosystem is probably completely screwed up 🙃"

ouvq2t,"Getting beat down by a career in sustainability. Don't really know what other sub to go to. \n\nI have worked really hard to find quality, impactful jobs that pertain to sustainable development. My undergrad is in literally, sustainability. I started as a coordinator for an urban farm and classroom, became a neighborhood revitalization specialist, then worked for a sustainable aid organization, as a Director, that sent refurbished, repaired, and reprogrammed medical equipment discarded by American companies to developing nations. For the past few years, I worked to create a green business certification and consulted for hundreds of local businesses for a local business coalition and now I am assisting with research for the UN in regards to sustainable sourcing. \n\nI recently realized that without a Masters, I will not be able to find a job within the sustainability field for more than 40k. I have a decent amount of experience in international sustainable supply chain, event planning, marketing, consulting, budgeting, grassroots organizing, managing volunteers, and more. \n\nThe top sustainability jobs go to people in the business world who have been there for decades who have some interest in sustainability. It does not go to people who learn about systems thinking, grassroots organization, triple bottom line thinking. It goes to the old guard, they surely know more than me in some things, but I chump it up to greenwashing. The other element is the wide variety of quality sustainability jobs (you know, not just selling solar panels or working at an urban garden). Some require 10 years of business experience for a Sustainability Manager job, and there is usually only one, if that, at a company. People who have worked in business for 10 years probably do not have a comprehensive understanding of sustainability. Just greenwashing and advertising of it. Then some require GIS, digital marketing skills etc etc. I can't keep up, if I hone one skill the next job opening that is decent will require another one.\n\nI am tired of trying. Just got a message that I didn't past a prescreening for a job that would have profoundly increased my income and impact. It was right in my wheelhouse, the dream job. It's just disappointing. There were five levels of interview, I didn't make it past a second look. I do not feel comfortable changing my career, knowing what is at stake, but boy is this just....hurting."

ow1dii,"Informative Writeup about Nanoplastic Pollution in the Oceans **Informative Writeup about Nanoplastic Pollution in the Oceans**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is nanoplastic ocean pollution: \n\nThere are many people who are aware of the environmental issues caused by the buildup of human waste products, composed mostly of plastic goods such as grocery bags, in the ocean gyres(circulating ocean currents). However most people do not realize the subsequent problem caused by the degradation of macro scale synthetic plastics into molecular sized micro &amp; nano plastics which go on to circulate the entire ocean &amp; thus interfere--usually in a detrimental fashion--with the biochemical interactions of every ecosystem in the ocean; disrupting marine ecosystems has indirect impacts, once again mostly negative, on the environmental integrity of ecosystems as well as the biogeochemical, energy &amp; resource cycles that regulate the planet. Nanoplastics are composed of artificially bonded carbon &amp; hydrogen atoms with additions of elements such as oxygen, chlorine &amp; nitrogen using non biological processes that rely on machinery &amp; other human technology to be produced. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCause of nanoplastic ocean pollution:\n\nHuman civilization &amp; the associated industrial production of consumer goods is arguably the sole cause of the mass pollution of the oceans with artificial, environmentally toxic, nanoplastic particles. Put simply, the reason there are nanoplastic particles dispersed to nearly every marine ecosystem is that human civilization, since the mid 1800s, has been producing synthetic plastic products in huge numbers due to the economic efficiency of plastic &amp; subsequently disposing of massive amounts of plastic waste products into the Ocean without considering the long-term consequences of such ignorance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnvironmental impact:\n\nBecause of their foreign, artificial &amp; man-made molecular structure nanoplastics are uniquely stable &amp; hardy to the point they persist throughout numerous marine ecosystems, usually decreasing the biodiversity, energy yield, resource yield &amp; overall integrity of the ecosystems. Nanoplastic particles accumulate in the biological organs of marine species--from coastal sea kelp to deep sea jellyfish--, which negatively impacts their biochemical regulation of homeostasis &amp; growth, causing the populations of numerous marine species to collapse. Also, nanoplastics can integrate chemically into physical components of the ocean such as the seafloor or underwater thermal vents, the long-term environmental impacts of these interactions have not been studied extensively yet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHuman impact: \n\nDue to bioaccumulation of nanoplastic particles in the organs of marine organisms from producer species like seaweed to consumers such as fish &amp; clams, humans also consume relatively large amounts of toxic, synthetic, reactive &amp; potentially carcinogenic nanoplastic particles when they consume food that is sourced from the ocean. Accumulation of nanoplastics in vital organs such as the heart, liver, kidneys &amp; more has caused significant health issues for humans, however more research must be done on the long term impact of nanoplastic interaction with human organs &amp; biochemical processes in order to better understand the array of subsequent health issues &amp; how to treat them. Either way, chemicals that were completely alien &amp; nonexistent to human civilization only 200 years ago are now biochemically integrated into the organs of basically every living thing on Earth, including humans. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMethods currently being used to combat nanoplastic ocean pollution:\n\n* According to the scientists who wrote the article linked below, “In this respect, [thermochemical conversion](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/thermochemical-conversion) of plastic waste into energy is a promising management option. Further, molecular and -omics technologies can also facilitate the [microbial biodegradation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/microbial-biodegradation) of MPs/NPs by enhancing enzymatic activity levels.”\n   * Thermochemical conversion is the use of heat energy &amp; manipulation of chemical reactions in order to convert the chemical structure of nanoplastic particles into a compound that is less environmentally toxic while also harnessing usable energy from the process.\n   * Microbial biodegradation involves genetically engineering the appropriate genetic code for the enzymes, regulatory sequences, transcription factors &amp; other accessory hereditary information necessary into the RNA or DNA of a bacterial strain such that the strain metabolizes particles of nanoplastic, with the product of the metabolic reaction being a non environmentally toxic compound. \n* The ocean cleanup project aims to remove macro size waste from the ocean gyres using an autonomous ocean garbage sweeper mechanism &amp; carrier vessels for the collected garbage. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow individuals/***you*** can contribute to solving the problem:\n\n* Decrease your personal consumption of consumer goods, especially goods manufactured using plastic or packaged in plastic products.\n* Whenever you see litter outside, specifically in relatively undisturbed ecosystems such as forests or coastlines, pick up &amp; properly dispose of the litter. \n* Use goods made from recycled materials or biodegradable materials that are more environmentally sustainable. \n* If you really want to contribute: Become a scientist who researches sustainable biotechnology &amp; biochemical environment regulation techniques or become an environmental activist/preservationist. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLink to Scientific Journal Entry about nanoplastic ocean pollution &amp; citation:\n\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652620352847](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652620352847) \n\nPrabhat Kumar Rai, Jechan Lee, Richard J.C.

But the more I think about it, the more I think we should analyze ourselves (or have someone do it) first prior to trying to set a goal date."

owmc75,"Slow Life: How to Live a Minimalist Life? **Slow Life: How to Live a Minimalist Life?**\n\nMan, there are so many unnecessary things.\n\nThe purpose of the minimalist lifestyle is to live minimally, not materially.\n\nMany  people misunderstand that a minimalist lifestyle is to pursue the least  material pursuits and the most empty rooms. A pair of shoes, a set of  clothes, very few electrical appliances. In my opinion, such ""ascetic""  minimalism will only make the current life worse.\n\nThe minimalist lifestyle is to face your real needs and think clearly about the relationship between your items and you.\n\nFor  example, for me, a computer is not only a tool for receiving  information, but also a carrier for recording information. This often  needs to be performed simultaneously. The dual-screen display is very  practical for me; basketball uniforms generally have 3-5 sets. It can be  changed and washed in time, and can be used as pajamas.\n\nCLICK HERE TO KNOW:  [How to live simply without being a minimalist](https://youtu.be/m6VD8GH6v-c)\n\nA minimalist lifestyle includes not only a reduction in numbers, but also a simplification of processes.\n\nA  little skill for an office worker. The first thing after arriving at  the office every morning is to turn on the phone. During the period, I  will organize and record the work that needs to be done today on a small  strip of A4 paper folded in half. The strips only need to be folded  horizontally and vertically, without cutting, they can be used for  several days. In this way, you can always know your working status.\n\nTherefore,  if you can establish some of your own processes in your daily life, you  will greatly simplify your life. Use Siri to make reminders to set  alarms, manage various account passwords, and classify and label your  friends' documents. There are a set of processes to form habits. , To  minimize the interference of daily chores to life.\n\nA minimalist lifestyle requires time to design and make good use of storage in advance.\n\nFor  example, dirty clothes are put in the laundry basket in the washroom,  shopping labels are affixed to the refrigerator, and toilet paper and  razors are placed in handy positions. Wireless charging devices for  mobile phones are placed in the office on the car.\n\nA minimalist lifestyle should focus on the simplification of choices.\n\nDon’t  buy things that you can buy or not. Before you buy, think about what  you can replace. When choosing, remember to be silent for a minute and  see your true desires clearly.\n\nThe goal of minimalism should be to save energy by simplifying life and focus on what is worth focusing on.\n\nCLICK HERE TO KNOW:  [How to live simply without being a minimalist](https://youtu.be/m6VD8GH6v-c)\n\nThere  are many things worth focusing on, such as careers, or companionship  with lovers and children, or travel, or food. The minimalist lifestyle  helps us escape the haze and disturbance of life and choose a real and  interesting life.\n\nCompared with material simplicity, ideological simplicity is the core.\n\nRecognize  your desires and greed, find the main line of life, and be willing to  take away more and more things and focus on the things you really care  about."

Unfortunately many recycled rolls come in plastic. Single use plastic has been the most important part of our journey to cut out. \n\nWhich is the better option, in your opinion?

I will take place tomorrow 8pm CET. (You can see the time for your timezone in the fb event) \n\nWe are lucky enough to have Nottingham Trent University's sustainability team give a talk on how we can all live more responsible and less wasteful lives.\n\nThe event will progress from discussing basic concepts of sustainability to understanding what has been done to create a greener future for students. The event will end with the opportunity for people to share their experiences and propose new projects that they can take back to university or the workplace.\n\nOur team will provide feedback and guidance on your ideas and help push them forward. The open discussion is an important part of the event and we hope that you join us and engage with people from all over the world on sustainability issues facing us all. If you don't want to get involved in the chat that's cool as well, with the knowledge you'll gain we hope you can still feel confident enough to go and kickstart your sustainability legacy.\n\nHere is the link to the facebook event:   \n [https://www.facebook.com/events/737688877079582](https://www.facebook.com/events/737688877079582) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nblhjbc32gc51.png?width=692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbeb0f465fb1ae256c8b07475bc674b4508a66b0"

I do not mind doing some sacrifices to help fighting the climate crisis since there are so many nice alternatives to all the products, transportation methods and living habits that cause the problem. As I was camping with some friends of mine back from school days, I saw how little of a f\*ck they gave when it came to energy or waste management. So, I wondered how I may convince them to also adapt their life (at least to some extend) to the ongoing crisis. \n\nI mean they all know about the amounts of plastic in the oceans, the problem with the current amount of emitted greenhouse gases and so on. The Problem is just not particularly tangible. So they don’t seem to care. (It’s not that they burn the woods and throw radioactive waste in the rivers but there is just little consideration of waste reduction when buying groceries)\n\n**How do I get them to care** without sounding like a climate activist cliché? I don’t want to make it seem like such an effort and potential even “scare” them as if they were never allowed to have fun again… This might not sound like such a big deal, but I struggle with convincing others with uncomfortable opinions.\n\n  And even further, how to I convince strangers, how probably know the facts but act on them?"

i0immi,"Advice needed on promoting an environmental song on Youtube A couple of years ago I wrote a song and asked people from all over the world to sing it. After that I made a video and asked the copyright owners for permission to include the fragments I had used. Practically everyone was enthousiastic and happy to contribute, including some international charities, reaffirming my faith in humanity. There were some disappointments though. I had used about 4 seconds from the BBC's 'Planet Earth' for example and since this footage was vital to the 'story' in my video I must have written and called ten different departments within their organisation to ask permission. All of them told me the same thing. They would only provide the clip against a hefty sum   of money. Since I did not want to spend/earn one cent with this project I ended up spending days trying to find a fragment to replace it with. I then encountered the same policy with CNN and a few other organisations that pretend to care about our planet, but care about money more. Funny enough, this was all in line with the message of the song: If we want change we should not wait for companies/governements. We need to come together and force it ourselves. \n\nAnyway, after finally finding some powerful footage to fill the empty spot I shared the song on Facebook and with the help of the people that had contributed to it it ended up getting quite a bit of exposure. It was shared about 4500 times and received a lot of positive feedback. I like to believe it pushed a few people in the right direction.\n\nMeanwhile Greta Thunberg was doing the same thing on an infinitely bigger scale. I continued doing my small part making memes and having endless discussions online and offline about sustainability.\n\nI felt things started to look promising for the movement and then Covid came along. All of a sudden we cared about nothing else than the virus and are polluting the planet at a record breaking pace.\n\nI have to admit I myself was kind of distracted by it as well, after it took my job (musician) and I had to find something else to bring food to the table. Anyway, after having found another source of income I would like to focus on sustainability again and figured I might as well try to spread the song a little further. It is totally stuck on Youtube though and I have no idea on how to get it moving there. If anyone could help me out I would greatly appreciate it. It is called 'Drops of rain' by the way. If you search this on Facebook you will surely find it. On Youtube you probably won't . :)\n\nThanks! Even for just reading this message. These are way more words than I was planning to type!"

i4u8bc,"This is probably the only time that I’ll promote in this subreddit, but I wanted to let you know about my YouTube channel Hi Folks,\n\nI recently decided to start my own YouTube channel with the goal of helping people who are new in their environmental journey or are looking for ideas of the next thing to change.\n\n\nMy effort is to use realistic numbers and potential savings in order to help get the point across. At the same time, I eventually plan to start a series where I highlight and elevate companies who are doing more to help the environment since I believe that many of us have trouble finding them on our own.\n\n\nMy video about composting just released today. It’s a quick 2.5 minute introduction to composting and goes over the damage that food waste does to the environment, 3 main types of composting which you could choose from, and the fact that “pay as you throw systems” are becoming more common so this will likely give you a lower trash bill eventually.\n\n\nGive it a watch if this sounds interesting to you. I’d also love to hear any good or bad feedback which you might have for me. Here’s the link:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QUQzCwNUMNM\n\n\nOk, that’s probably the last self promotion that you’ll ever see from me in this sub!"
i4yrva,"Energy star appliance rebates backfires I have heard a story about how energy star efficient appliances are leading to greater energy use. \n\nThe story goes that many people in California bought a new fridge and then put the old one in the garage for beer. \n\nIn short, a person buys a new energy star appliance, takes the rebate, but keeps the old appliance and often places it in the garage where the ambient temperature is higher.  The outcome is that now there are two appliances and one is using more than it used too.  \n\nI can’t find evidence of this though.  A few articles about the backfire effect.  \n\nHas anyone heard of this?  TIA for any links, reports, or anecdotes."
i4zwjx,"Looking For Career Advice: Sustainable Design Hello!\n\nI'm trying to figure out a Masters moving forward. I thought I would go into policy, but I'm coming to terms with the fact that it's not my passion. \nI've realized, thanks to Redditors, that Sustainability is more of a philosophy and can be applied anywhere, which is great, but also terrifying with all the possibilities. \n\nI've never thought about what *I'm* passionate about (because that's fucking hard as shit) but I've realized that what I want to pursue is something Creative, something where I can promote Sustainability, possibly Artistic in nature, and I want to build things, or create things. From my current job experience, I also thrive in areas where I can have a diversity of objects on my plate, and it's not just an office job, like I can at least occasionally go outside. \n\nSo, one avenue I'm looking into that I'm curious about is Sustainable Design. Are there any Sustainable Designers or Architects here that I could chat with? I essentially would love to virtually shadow you, or just have a conversation and hear about what you do, and what got you into this field. \n\nI'm also open to new fields that have the above characteristics, but mostly I want to chat with those in Sustainable Design \n\nThank you!"

i5apj6,"Shifting sands: Legal dispossession of small-scale miners in an extractivist era  [https://research.ku.dk/search/result/?pure=en%2Fpublications%2Fshifting-sands(4b84ddda-b8b3-4c15-9dfe-7f2f83d53c14).html](https://research.ku.dk/search/result/?pure=en%2Fpublications%2Fshifting-sands(4b84ddda-b8b3-4c15-9dfe-7f2f83d53c14).html) \n\n This article argues that the entanglements of a growing global demand for construction material and neoliberal resource governance result in an incremental and piecemeal form of dispossession. While mining in Colombia has been broadly researched, little has been said about sand extraction and the challenges small-scale artisanal miners face when trying to formalise their activities. This article seeks to fill this gap by following a group of areneros (manual sand extractors) who attempt to defend their right to sand extraction against a competing mining claim. Drawn into the domain of the state, the areneros navigate a changing institutional setup and a complex legislation that favours the wealthy, the lettered and the connected. Political-economic interests are masked behind procedures, symbols and legal-administrative means, which create a ‘state effect’ and result in a subtle form of legal dispossession. The article points towards a scalar model of dispossession, in which small-scale mining activities pass through ‘small-scale intermediaries’ to end up in the hands of private corporate actors with capital and technical expertise to conduct large-scale extraction. The article adds to the limited literature on sand extraction and challenges the view that the activity is merely conducted by criminal actors; yet, it argues that subsistence mining is under threat by government and corporate interests, positioning sand extraction as a new resource frontier. As small-scale miners find themselves in the conflict between two competing rights regimes and two competing production logics, they are doubly stretched between proletarianization and eviction, criminalisation and self-erosion."

It also seems that there are a lot of different sources with different data, some of which are a bit conflicting. I saw another post here from a while back saying that it's probably better to see the environmental impact of food per calorie and not per kilogram.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. What are the different metrics that are used to measure how sustainable a food is? Some that come to mind are: CO2, water consumption, packaging (although that can vary a lot), ""healthiness"". Any others?\n2. Is there a reliable source to get this kind of information?"

i66gmx,"Animals, Nature and Cowardice **Cowardice**\n\nCowardice. It's an ugly word, a word nobody wants to be branded with. And branded is an appropriate term given the consequences of being labelled a coward in traditional society. It carries connotations of meekness, fear, emasculation and a loss of honour and pride; a coward forfeited his status as a man of the tribe. Throughout history cowardice has been dealt with as if a serious crime, in the best case scenario men would be excommunicated and ostracised, in the worst case they would be executed. To drop your shield in battle and turn heels was the ultimate act of shame, to abandon your duty to your family and people was to abandon your manhood and your right to exist amongst your people. \n\nBut what is cowardice? Some people would claim that cowardice is an emotion, a state of mind that we have no more control over than we have control over our capacity to love, hate or fear. I disagree with that sentiment. Cowardice isn't an emotion, it's a response to an emotion; a choice. It's a choice to buckle in the face of fear, a choice to follow the path of least resistance. It's a conscious effort to avoid pain, failure, struggle and duty. Cowardice is the antithesis to courage and virtue and everything that traditional society held in reverence. Cowardice, ultimately, is self serving and anti-natural. We have two choices when faced with the enormity and might of nature; we can run and hide or we can roll with the punches. When we choose to run and hide we sever our ties with the interconnectedness of life, we attempt to operate outside of its constraints and ultimately we lose what it means to be human. \n\n**Globalism &amp; The Abuse Of Nature**\n\nIf we accept that cowardice is the choice of following the path of least resistance then we must view the globalist technological society as a society built on the foundations of cowardice. Globalism, technological progress and the chasing of economic growth are responses to the fear of being defeated by nature. The building of cities dominated by steel and glass, automation and motorised transport plays a symbolic role in our psyche. It represents a fortress that we have built to keep nature out, it's a testament to our human arrogance of viewing ourselves as existing outside of nature, of wielding power and grabbing mother nature by the horns. So much so that technological society isn't content with merely escaping nature and its constraints, it wants to transcend nature. Transgenderism, transhumanism, genetic modification of humans, plants and animals and the bastardisation of nations are all the result of a cowardly refusal to accept the reality of life. \n\nThe importation of the entire world into overdeveloped cities is an unavoidable result of our escape from nature. In order to support ourselves outside of a natural life, a life that we evolved to exist within, we must create a machine capable of sustaining that anti-natural existence. That machine requires automation, it requires submissive slaves and it requires space, lots of space. A concrete city cannot sustain itself through hunting nor can it rely upon familial bond and duty, it must exploit and destroy if it wishes to survive. There are no wild fruit trees, no vegetables and no wild game in the city so it necessitates the building of a large scale agricultural machine. An agricultural machine that decimates native fauna and flora and one that outsources labour and decimates the native fauna and flora of foreign lands. Nowhere is safe from the ruinous, creeping tendrils of globalism and technological advancement. \n\n**Overpopulation, Animals &amp; Feeble Man**\n\nContinuous economic growth is both the result of and precursor to massive overpopulation. Continuous economic growth is no longer a means to an end, it has become the end because it is the only way for man to escape the often times brutal and unrelenting natural world. It is cowardice that drives us further into the bowels of technological society and it is cowardice that keeps us there. Modern man has become so impotent by design that he is no longer able to clothe himself or feed and provide shelter for his family, he instead mindlessly consumes commodities that are churned out by the system without consideration for any wider implications. He no longer exists as an organic entity, he is entrapped within the very fortress that he himself built for the sake of an easy life. \n\nWhat is the price to be paid for an easy life? Great swathes of forest are levelled to the ground and replaced with saplings barely knee high, or fields of wheat doused in pesticide and fertiliser, or factories, mills and slaughterhouses. Biodiversity is disregarded to make way for large quantities of potatoes and cereal to feed an ever growing number of mouths. Millions of animals are reared in unsanitary conditions waiting to be slaughtered or used for their milk or fur. Pigs that have lost the use of their back legs are beaten and kicked by unthinking drones to feed our children. Chickens are wedged into sandwich crates covered in their own urine and feces and driven into slaughterhouses where the smell of death is thick and cloying in the air. A miserable, unnatural and pitiful existence totally antithetical to the essential turnings of life. For what cause? To serve the bellies of an unthinking, cowardly mass too afraid to confront their own state as a part of the web of life. \n\nChildren in the modern world have never had to hunt or fish, never had to skin and prepare an animal, never been taught how to respect life and the part that we all play in it. A child nowadays doesn't understand the circle of life or the importance of protecting it with the fierceness that we protect our own families with. Take a child into the woods and ask him to identify this or that plant and they'll ask you were the aux input is. Ask a child if he knows how bread is made. Ask a child if he knows where his chicken nuggets come from and I can guarantee you that he is blissfully unaware of the horrors of unsanitary slaughterhouses. We shield children from the reality of where their food comes from because we know as matter of instinct that it is shameful and anti-natural. We would suffer no such shame teaching our children to forage or fish or hunt for their own food; and if we did then that speaks to the sorry state of affairs that we find ourselves in. \n\nHumanity has strayed so far from its humble origins of synergistic existence that being confronted with that reality conflicts us with a great deal of cognitive dissonance. And so we revert to form, we take the cowardly option and avert our eyes, put our fingers in our ears and keep on banging the anvil. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCowardice used to be the epitome of shame and dishonour, it was shunned and discouraged because it was understood that cowardice lead to a life completely devoid of virtue and meaning. Without struggle and hardship a people will never learn its own worth or be inclined to fight for its own existence. Life isn't easy or unconstrained, it isn't without sadness or pain and resorting to cowardice rarely changes that fact, it merely shifts the burden. While you may no longer have to expend energy both physical and emotional to find food or shelter, you most certainly will struggle to find meaning in life or connection with your people. You may well be able to self administer a shot of dopamine through porn or substance abuse but you will be hard pushed to feel a primal connection with your land and it's beautiful history. \n\nThis disconnection from the essence of what it means to be alive – hardship, achievement, self sustenance, reverence for your homeland – is the direct result of a global society. The world simply cannot sustain a large, ever growing global society. Humans did not evolve in a global community. We did at one time exist in small, high trust, self sustaining communities. The populations of these communities were regulated by the abundance, or lack thereof, of raw materials. If materials were scarce then the population remained small by necessity, it was economical with its resources. Protecting the environment wasn't a political tool or an inconvenience, it was vital to survival. Times were hard and life had many challenges but comradery and kinship amongst your folk reached a spiritual level. Something that is alien to modern man. To live was to be courageous, virtuous, bold; sitting at home twiddling your thumbs waiting for the microwave to ding was not an option. \n\nContrast this way of life – where cowardice meant death or dishonour – with the modern world. Cowardice has become the default position because there is incentive for that to be so. All you have to do is tow the line, clock into work or sign on at the job centre and everything that our ancestors had to work tirelessly for is offered up to you on a plate. But at what cost? Are you happy? We have become cattle whose sole purpose is to perpetuate the ever grinding march of progress and economic growth. Small pockets of people still exist who live in harmony with the natural world but for how much longer? The day when the great maw of globalism finally swallows them up and builds a metropolis on the last remaining villages creeps ever closer. Nowhere is safe. Cowardice did this."

i6qvjl,"Used goods vs. Environmentally friendly new goods Hello. I've been using my mid-range smartphone for 5 years now, and I've been thinking of finally giving it a rest and getting a new device. With sustainability in mind, I've ended up with two options - either buying a new product from an environmentally friendly company like Fairphoone, or buying a used product, for example a 2 year old Google Pixel or something like that. This choice left me with a question that extends beyond this specific case - what are the reasons for why I would want to buy a new product, from an environmentally friendly company over buying a used product? There is a part of me that wants the new phone because, well, it's new, and thinking that supporting companies like that is, simply put, good, but no matter how I look at it, used goods seem to just have a smaller impact on the environment, no matter how the new product was manufactured.\n\nIn general, this leads to a question I've been asking myself - isn't an environmentally friendly company a sort of oxymoron? If somebody really wants to make phone usage more sustainable, wouldn't it make more sense to campaign for and encourage purchasing used phones, instead of making a new one? Wouldn't a truly environmentally friendly manufacturer just... not manufacture anything? Of course, there are limits to this, if every manufacturer told you to buy used phones, soon there wouldn't be any used phones left as the supply of new phones to be used and resold would dry up, but in the current climate, with dozens of manufacturers making hundreds of thousands of phones, how is it good for the environment to add to that number?"

Did you ever wish there was a way you could dispose of it sustainably? Well, you’re probably thinking that I’m about to suggest a solution to these problems that’s both nonsensical and impossible. That’s a perfectly understandable and reasonable doubt to have, especially since many of those items can’t be recycled into something else. However, they can be reused by another person who is in the same situation as you are. Introducing: Swapabee!\n\nSwapabee works by exchanging your unwanted item with someone else’s on the Swapabee market. Once you’ve found an item you want to swap for, make an offer for it with an item of your own. Once a swap has been agreed with another person, you can arrange a time and place for the trade to take place. And that’s it!\n\nDuring the current crisis, Swapabee has proven to be useful to many people who have found the free time during quarantine to swap products they no longer need. This is evident in the fact that they’ve experienced a 300% increase on their site since the start of COVID-19. Now, you might be concerned about having to swap in-person at this time, but you also have the option of posting and receiving your items via mail!

i9miot,"Revolutionizing Milk Packaging (Again) This is going to sound strange at first but maybe the milkman should never have gone ""extinct."" The milkman was a staple of American households in the early twentieth century. According to USDA Agricultural surveys, around 30 percent of households still paid for a milk service in 1960. To the point though... \n\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1964/08/02/archives/plastic-is-new-entry-in-battle-of-the-milk-bottles.html\n\nThe article linked above is a NYT release from 1964, at a time when the glass bottle was rapidly beginning to be replaced by its (ugly) counterpart, the plastic container. Phillip's Petroleum Company, now morphed as parent company Conoco-Phillips, was attempting to take control of the plastic milk container market by simplifying the process for farmers. At this point, it would have been easy to see how the proliferation of plastic containers was going to take over many more industries as well...the plastic makers always know what they're introducing, the impacts those products have and how many people will use them if marketed and deployed properly.\n\n\nThe plastic makers seem to want to give out their product freely, flaunting its benefits and its vast use-cases. They hook populations by making other alternatives uneconomical and seemingly difficult to obtain. \n\n\nThe linked article below is today's processes for bottling milk. By the way, I don't necessarily condone/agree with any other views and opinions from this source.\n https://milk.procon.org/how-milk-gets-from-the-cow-to-the-store/#step_7\n\n\nMy local Byrne Dairy (convenience/gasosline but also runs local dairy farms and creamery) sells milk in plastic, cardboard and glass containers. I bought plastic for the longest time because that's just what my parents did. When my fiance and I moved out, we started to utilize their glass container refund/deposit service. I still have to go down and pick up the glasses myself, but I'm doing that when I need other things like eggs, cheese, yogurt etc. Milk by the glass is cheaper at Byrne Dairy since they reuse their glass containers when you bring them back! They sanitize and refill the containers as many times as possible. I would bet that there's an argument to how much more sustainable this actually is due to the resources going into washing, transporting and refilling the containers BUT when hundreds of containers are transported together, we reduce the amount of plastic in the environment, and support local businesses I would have to see substantial evidence that reverting to plastic is more sustainable.\n\nTLDR: We used to use refillable glass milk jugs, now we don't because plastic producers made it too cheap/easy not to. The moral of the story here is to Refillable Containers whenever, wherever for as long as possible to slow the eventual resting place of that item and decrease the amount of shit entering our landfills every day."

ia574y,"Why we need to think more carefully about what money is and how it works Most of us have overlooked a fundamental problem that is currently causing an insurmountable obstacle to building a fairer and more sustainable world. We are very familiar with the thing in question, but its problematic nature has been hidden from us by a powerful illusion. We think the problem is capitalism, but capitalism is just the logical outcome of aggregate human decisions about how to manage money. The fundamental problem is money itself, or more specifically general purpose money and the international free market which allows you to sell a chunk of rainforest and use the money to buy a soft drink factory. (You can use the same sort of money to sell anything and buy anything, anywhere in the world, and until recently there was no alternative at all. Bitcoin is now an alternative, but is not quite what we are looking for.) The illusion is that because market prices are free, and nobody is forced into a transaction, those prices must be fair – that the exchange is equitable. The truth is that the way the general money globalised free market system works means that even though the prices are freely determined, there is still an unequal flow of natural resources from poor parts of the world to rich parts. This means the poor parts will always remain poor, and resources will continue to accumulate in the large, unsustainable cities in rich countries. In other words, unless we re-invent money, we cannot overturn capitalism, and that means we can't build a sustainable civilisation. \n\nWhy does this matter? What use is it realising that general purpose money is at the root of our problems when we know that the rich and powerful people who run this world will do everything in their power to prevent the existing world system being reformed? They aren't just going to agree to get rid of general purpose money and economic globalisation. It's like asking them to stop pursuing growth: they can't even imagine how to do it, and don't want to. So how does this offer us a way forwards?\n\nAnswer: because the two things in question – our monetary system and globalisation – look like being among the first casualties of collapse. Globalisation is already going into reverse (see brexit, Trump's protectionism) and our fiat money system is heading towards a debt/inflation implosion.   \n\nIt looks highly likely that the scenario going forwards will be of increasing monetary and economic chaos. Fiat money systems have collapsed many times before, but never a global system of fiat currencies floating against each other. But regardless of how may fiat currencies collapse, or how high the price of gold goes in dollars, it is not clear what the system would be replaced with. Can we just go back to the gold standard? It is possible, but people will be desperately looking for other solutions, and the people in power might also be getting desperate. \n\nSo what could replace it? What is needed is a new sort of money system which both \n\n(a) addresses the immediate economic problems of people suffering from symptoms of economic and general collapse and \n\n(b) provides a long-term framework around which a new sort of economy can emerge – an economy which is *adapted to deglobalisation and degrowth*. \n\nI have been searching for answers to this question for some time, and have now found what I was looking for.  It is explained in [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nature-Society-Justice-Anthropocene-Money-Energy-Technology/dp/1108429378/) recently published academic book, and this [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323102274_How_to_turn_an_ocean_liner_a_proposal_for_voluntary_degrowth_by_redesigning_money_for_sustainability_justice_and_resilience) by the same professor of economic anthropology (Alf Hornborg).  \nThe answer is the creation of a new sort of money, but it is critically important exactly how this is done. **Local currencies like the Bristol Pound do not challenge globalisation.** What we need is a new sort of national currency. This currency would be issued as a UBI, but only usable to buy products and services originating within an adjustable radius. This would enable a new economy to emerge. It actually resists globalisation and promotes the growth of a new sort of economy where sustainability is built on local resources and local economic activity. It would also reverse the trend of population moving from poor rural areas and towns, to cities. It would revitalise the “left behind” parts of the western world, and put the brakes on the relentless flow of natural resources and “embodied cheap labour” from the poor parts of the world to the rich parts. It would set the whole system moving towards a more sustainable and fairer state. \n\nThis may sound unrealistic, but please give it a chance. I believe it offers a way forwards that can \n\n(a) unite disparate factions trying to provoke systemic change, including eco-marxists, greens, posthumanists and anti-globalist supporters of “populist nationalism”. The only people who really stand to lose are the supporters of global big business and the 1%. \n\n(b) offers a realistic alternative to a money system heading towards collapse, and to which currently no other realistic alternative is being proposed. \n\nIn other words, this offers a **realistic way forwards** not just right now but through much of the early stages of collapse. **It is likely to become both politically and economically viable within the forseeable future.** It does, though, require some elements of the left to abandon its globalist ideals.  It will have to embrace a new sort of nationalism. And it will require various groups who are doing very well out of the current economic system to realise that it is doomed. \n\nHere is an FAQ (from the paper). \n\n1. What is a complementary currency? It is a form of money that can be used alongside regular money.\n\n2. What is the fundamental goal of this proposal? The two most fundamental goals motivating this   \nproposal are to insulate local human subsistence and livelihood from the vicissitudes of national   \nand international economic cycles and financial speculation, and to provide tangible and attractive   \nincentives for people to live and consume more sustainably. It also seeks to provide authorities   \nwith a means to employ social security expenditures to channel consumption in sustainable   \ndirections and encourage economic diversity and community resilience at the local level. \n\n3. Why should the state administrate the reform? The nation is currently the most encompassing   \npolitical entity capable of administrating an economic reform of this nature. Ideally it is also   \nsubservient to the democratic decisions of its population. The current proposal is envisaged as an   \noption for European nations, but would seem equally advantageous for countries anywhere. If   \nsuccessfully implemented within a particular nation or set of nations, the system can be expected   \nto be emulated by others. Whereas earlier experiments with alternative currencies have generally   \nbeen local, bottom-up initiatives, a state-supported program offers advantages for long-term   \nsuccess. Rather than an informal, marginal movement connected to particular identities and   \ntransient social networks, persisting only as long as the enthusiasm of its founders, the   \ncomplementary currency advocated here is formalized, efficacious, and lastingly fundamental to   \neveryone's economy. \n\n4. How is local use defined and monitored? The complementary currency (CC) can only be used to   \npurchase goods and services that are produced within a given geographical radius of the point of   \npurchase. This radius can be defined in terms of kilometers of transport, and it can vary between   \ndifferent nations and regions depending on circumstances. A fairly simple way of distinguishing   \nlocal from non-local commodities would be to label them according to transport distance, much as   \nis currently done regarding, for instance, organic production methods or ""fair trade."" Such   \ntransport certification would of course imply different labelling in different locales. \n\n5. How is the complementary currency distributed? A practical way of organizing distribution would   \nbe to provide each citizen with a plastic card which is electronically charged each month with the   \nsum of CC allotted to him or her. \n\n6. Who are included in the category of citizens? A monthly CC is provided to all inhabitants of a   \nnation who have received official residence permits. \n\n7. What does basic income mean? Basic income is distributed without any requirements or duties to   \nbe fulfilled by the recipients. The sum of CC paid to an individual each month can be determined   \nin relation to the currency's purchasing power and to the individual's age. The guiding principle   \nshould be that the sum provided to each adult should be sufficient to enable basic existence, and   \nthat the sum provided for each child should correspond to the additional household expenses it   \nrepresents. \n\n8. Why would people want to use their CC rather than regular money? As the sum of CC provided   \neach month would correspond to purchases representing a claim on his or her regular budget, the   \nbasic income would liberate a part of each person's regular income and thus amount to substantial   \npurchasing power, albeit restricted only to local purchases. The basic income in CC would reduce   \na person's dependence on wage labor and the risks currently associated with unemployment. It   \nwould encourage social cooperation and a vitalization of community. \n\n9. Why would businesses want to accept payment in CC? Business entrepreneurs can be expected to   \nrespond rapidly to the radically expanded demand for local products and services, which would   \nprovide opportunities for a diverse range of local niche markets. Whether they receive all or only   \na part of their income in the form of CC, they can choose to use some of it to purchase tax-free   \nlocal labor or other inputs, and to request to have some of it converted by the authorities to regular   \ncurrency (see next point). \n\n10. How is conversion of CC into regular currency organized? Entrepreneurs would be granted the   \nright to convert some of their CC into regular currency at exchange rates set by the authorities.   \nThe exchange rate between the two currencies can be calibrated so as to compensate the   \nauthorities for loss of tax revenue and to balance the in- and outflows of CC to the state. The rate   \nwould thus amount to a tool for determining the extent to which the CC is recirculated in the local   \neconomy, or returned to the state. This is important in order to avoid inflation in the CC sector. \n\n11. Would there be interest on sums of CC owned or loaned? There would be no interest accruing on   \na sum of CC, whether a surplus accumulating in an account or a loan extended. \n\n12. How would saving and loaning of CC be organized? The formal granting of credit in CC would   \nbe managed by state authorities and follow the principle of full reserve banking, so that quantities   \nof CC loaned would never exceed the quantities saved by the population as a whole. \n\n13. Would the circulation of CC be subjected to taxation? No. \n\n14. Why would authorities want to encourage tax-free local economies? Given the beneficial social   \nand ecological consequences of this reform, it is assumed that nation states will represent the   \ngeneral interests of their electorates and thus promote it. Particularly in a situation with rising   \nfiscal deficits, unemployment, health care, and social security expenditures, the proposed reform   \nwould alleviate financial pressure on governments. It would also reduce the rising costs of   \ntransport infrastructure, environmental protection, carbon offsetting, and climate change   \nadaptation. In short, the rising costs and diminishing returns on current strategies for economic   \ngrowth can be expected to encourage politicians to consider proposals such as this, as a means of   \navoiding escalating debt or even bankruptcy. \n\n15. How would the state's expenditures in CC be financed? As suggested above, much of these   \nexpenditures would be balanced by the reduced costs for social security, health care, transport   \ninfrastructure, environmental protection, carbon offsetting, and climate change adaptation. As   \nthese savings may take time to materialize, however, states can choose to make a proportion of   \ntheir social security payments (pensions, unemployment insurance, family allowance, etc.) in the   \nform of CC. As between a third and half of some nations' annual budgets are committed to social   \nsecurity, this represents a significant option for financing the reform, requiring no corresponding   \ntax levies. \n\n16. What are the differences between this CC and the many experiments with local currencies? This   \nproposal should not be confused with the notion, or with the practical operation, of local   \ncurrencies, as it does not imply different currencies in different locales but one national,   \ncomplementary currency for local use. Nor is it locally initiated and promoted in opposition to the   \nregular currency, but centrally endorsed and administrated as an accepted complement to it. Most   \nimportantly, the alternative currency can only be used to purchase products and services   \noriginating from within a given geographical range, a restriction which is not implemented in   \nexperiments with Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS). Finally, the CC is provided as a basic   \nincome to all residents of a nation, rather than only earned in proportion to the extent to which a   \nperson has made him- or herself useful in the local economy. \n\n17. What would the ecological benefits be? The reform would radically reduce the demand for long-   \ndistance transport, the production of greenhouse gas emissions, consumption of energy and   \nmaterials, and losses of foodstuffs through overproduction, storage, and transport. It would   \nincrease recycling of nutrients and packaging materials, which means decreasing leakage of   \nnutrients and less garbage. It would reduce agricultural intensification, increase biodiversity, and   \ndecrease ecological degradation and vulnerability. \n\n18. What would the societal benefits be? The reform would increase local cooperation, decrease   \nsocial marginalization and addiction problems, provide more physical exercise, improve psycho-   \nsocial and physical health, and increase food security and general community resilience. It would   \ndecrease the number of traffic accidents, provide fresher and healthier food with less   \npreservatives, and improved contact between producers and consumers. \n\n19. What would the long-term consequences be for the economy? The reform would no doubt   \ngenerate radical transformations of the economy, as is precisely the intention. There would be a   \nsignificant shift of dominance from transnational corporations founded on financial speculation   \nand trade in industrially produced foodstuffs, fuels, and other internationally transported goods to   \nlocally diverse producers and services geared to sustainable livelihoods. This would be a   \ndemocratic consequence of consumer power, rather than of legislation. Through a relatively   \nsimple transformation of the conditions for market rationality, governments can encourage new   \nand more sustainable patterns of consumer behavior. In contrast to much of the drastic and often   \ntraumatic economic change of the past two centuries, these changes would be democratic and   \nsustainable and would improve local and national resilience. \n\n20. Why should society want to encourage people to refrain from formal employment? It is   \nincreasingly recognized that full or high employment cannot be a goal in itself, particularly if it   \nimplies escalating environmental degradation and energy and material throughput. Well-founded   \ncalls are thus currently made for degrowth, i.e. a reduction in the rate of production of goods and   \nservices that are conventionally quantified by economists as constitutive of GDP. Whether formal   \nunemployment is the result of financial decline, technological development, or intentional policy   \nfor sustainability, no modern nation can be expected to leave its citizens economically unsupported. To subsist on basic income is undoubtedly more edifying than receiving unemployment insurance; the CC system encourages useful community cooperation and creative activities rather than destructive behavior that may damage a person's health. \n\n21. Why should people receive an income without working? As observed above, modern nations will   \nprovide for their citizens whether they are formally employed or not. The incentive to find   \nemployment should ideally not be propelled only by economic imperatives, but more by the desire   \nto maintain a given identity and to contribute creatively to society. Personal liberty would be   \nenhanced by a reform which makes it possible for people to choose to spend (some of) their time   \non creative activities that are not remunerated on the formal market, and to accept the tradeoff   \nimplied by a somewhat lower economic standard. People can also be expected to devote a greater   \nproportion of their time to community cooperation, earning additional CC, which means that they   \nwill contribute more to society – and experience less marginalization – than the currently   \nunemployed. \n\n22. Would savings in CC be inheritable? No. \n\n23. How would transport distances of products and services be controlled? It is reasonable to expect   \nthe authorities to establish a special agency for monitoring and controlling transport distances. It   \nseems unlikely that entrepreneurs would attempt to cheat the system by presenting distantly   \nproduced goods as locally produced, as we can expect income in regular currency generally to be   \npreferable to income in CC. Such attempts would also entail transport costs which should make   \nthe cargo less competitive in relation to genuinely local produce, suggesting that the logic of local   \nmarket mechanisms would by and large obviate the problem. \n\n24. How would differences in local conditions (such as climate, soils, and urbanism) be dealt with?   \nIt is unavoidable that there would be significant variation between different locales in terms of the   \nconditions for producing different kinds of goods. This means that relative local prices in CC for a   \ngiven product can be expected to vary from place to place. This may in turn mean that   \nconsumption patterns will vary somewhat between locales, which is predictable and not   \nnecessarily a problem. Generally speaking, a localization of resource flows can be expected to   \nresult in a more diverse pattern of calibration to local resource endowments, as in premodern   \ncontexts. The proposed system allows for considerable flexibility in terms of the geographical   \ndefinition of what is categorized as local, depending on such conditions. In a fertile agricultural   \nregion, the radius for local produce may be defined, for instance, as 20 km, whereas in a less   \nfertile or urban area, it may be 50 km. People living in urban centers are faced with a particular   \nchallenge. The reform would encourage an increased production of foodstuffs within and in the   \nvicinity of urban areas, which in the long run may also affect urban planning. People might also   \nchoose to move to the countryside, where the range of subsistence goods that can be purchased   \nwith CC will tend to be greater. In the long run, the reform can be expected to encourage a better   \nfit between the distribution of resources (such as agricultural land) and demography. This is fully   \nin line with the intention of reducing long-distance transports of necessities. \n\n25. What would the consequences be if people converted resources from one currency sphere into   \nproducts or services sold in another? It seems unfeasible to monitor and regulate the use of   \ndistant imports (such as machinery and fuels) in producing produce for local markets, but as   \nproduction for local markets is remunerated in CC, this should constitute a disincentive to invest   \nregular money in such production processes. Production for local consumption can thus be   \nexpected to rely mostly – and increasingly – on local labor and other resource inputs."

ibdu58,"What the hell are ""global industrial greenhouse gas emissions""?

I was a little confused as to the actual definition of this, as the study doesn't outline it at all, so I Googled it with little luck.\n\n[This site](https://world101.cfr.org/global-era-issues/climate-change/who-releases-most-greenhouse-gases) says the following:\n\n&gt; In 2015 alone, fossil fuel companies and their products, particularly oil and gas, were responsible for 91 percent of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions and around 70 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions tied to human activity.  \n\nSo now I'm just confused, it seems like these figures oppose one another and now my understanding of the definition is even more muddied.

That would put you at 20,000 annual bezos dollars. \n \nFor you, it will take a little longer than our 6 figure friend above, at:\n181000000000/20000= 9 million years to become a Bezos! \nIn other words, you would have needed to start working around the time when chimpanzees and gorillas were evolving into different species during the late miocene period. Better work harder!\n\nThank you for taking the time to participate in the bezos project.\n\nPlease now take the time to consider my questions;\n\nWho decides what is normal?\n\nAnd\n\nWill this exercise lead to a behavioral change for you?\n\nSo... how many Bezos years are you?\n\nP.S.\nJust for fun, I ran the math for the highest ever paid female athlete in history, Naomi Osaka, who made 37.4 million last year.

There were select items of ""organically sourced"" clothing on cardboard hangers, they were promoting glass soap displays and bamboo toothbrushes with The Humble Co, among other things. All items were reasonably priced. \n\nI have to admit I was a little taken aback by the stall because Primark would be a store I would avoid without question, along with contributing to fast fashion in general. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else noticed this, as I had gotten a sponsored ad about this range on social media not long after leaving the store. I wouldn't know a lot about the ethics behind Primark but I know enough not to contribute, so I was skeptical about it when I saw it.

idbwgw,"Zero waste- pointless and privileged I believe zero waste is a pointless and privileged concept. Even if you were to spend your entire life using almost no plastic, your actions will never make even the tiniest bit of a difference. Zero waste people tend to view themselves as the greatest thing since sliced bread, as if going out of your way to bring a burlap sack to the supermarket to buy your gluten free chia seeds makes you somehow morally superior. It’s an ideology that’s both pretentious and annoying af. Furthermore, it’s ironic to me how the radical left are the ones preaching about this zero waste lifestyle, primarily because having the time and money to be able to shop at specialty stores is pretty much the literal definition of privileged. It’s just another way for people to feel good about themselves for doing something essentially meaningless, so another form of virtue signaling."

ies03j,"Idleness as a path to a more sustainable way of life **Departure into Emptiness - Climate Crisis, Idleness and Mysticism (Essay by Jupp Hartmann, Excerpt)**\n\nI.\n\n**Not as much!**  That is the imperative of our age: less plastic, less CO2, less    consumption, less stress. That sounds like a renunciation: of meat, of    flying, of  driving cars.\n\nBut  does this necessarily have to be a renunciation? It would be  renunciation  to  deny yourself the fulfill­ment of a deep desire. Not  doing something because there is a better choice: that is freedom.\n\nThere  are good reasons to use that freedom: need­ing less can be full of its  own pleasure. It means be­ing less dependent and - instead of constantly  chas­ing after the satisfaction of needs - having more time   for the  really important things.\n\n*“Those who have lost by being moderate are rare.” (Confucius, Analects, IV.23)*\n\nII.\n\n**Doing and leaving**  are what shape our perception of the world. A woodcutter, a biologist  and an in­vestor perceive the same forest in a completely dif­ferent  way. Whoever is taking on a task must be careful not to be taken over by  the task. The more the focus is on predetermined goals, the more the    view of collateral damage is lost.\n\nIn  a world of numbers and financial streams, every­thing becomes a means  to an end. The earth be­comes a raw material warehouse and people   become  human capital. Everything becomes a utility. What is useless or  not useful enough from an economic point of view is in danger. Primeval    forests are being cut down; animal and plant species are becoming  extinct; in the name of utility a huge destruction is underway.\n\nIt  would often be better if less were done. But this is difficult to  achieve, because many people despair when they have nothing to do. They  cling to their occupations. Often  work is the center of their lives -    and for many it is the source of their identity.\n\nIn    our performance-oriented times, this can be seen with extreme  clarity. That it is not a new phenome­non, however, is proven by a more  than two thou­sand year old text from China:\n\n*“When  the farmer has nothing more to do with grass and weeds, he has nothing  more to hold on to; when the merchant has nothing more to do with alleys  and markets, he has nothing more to hold on to. Only when the  people  of  the crowd have their daily work, do they make an effort. The  craftsmen  depend on the skill and handling of their tools to feel   themselves. If  he can­not accumulate money and goods, the scrooge   becomes sad. If power and influence do not expand steadily, the   ambitious man becomes  desolate.The slaves of power and wealth are only   happy when in the  process of change. If they find a time when they can   act, they cannot  stop acting. They all follow their path with the  same  regularity as the  cycle of the year. They are caught up in the  world of  things and cannot  change. So they run along, internally and  externally  trapped, sinking  into the world of things and never coming  back to  themselves. Oh, how  sad!” (Zhuangzi,XXIV.4)*\n\nSo  what can be done is done - and that is often much more than what needs  to be done. We virtu­ally suffocate under the mass of products that our  productivity produces.\n\nIII.\n\n**Idleness**.  A word that has fallen into disrepute. Idleness, as the proverb warns,  is the root of all vice; and more than a few even see in it the worst of  all vices: the refusal to perform in a performance-based society.\n\nThe  calls for deceleration, which are becoming louder and louder, have  rehabilitated idleness to a certain extent in recent years. In the  wellness sector at least it has found a firm place - and in countless    magazine articles when it has to do finding oneself or burnout syndrome.\n\nIdleness  requires free time. This is more than leisure time: it is a time free  of constraints, empty time that can be filled with what the moment  offers.\n\nCaught in the daily hustle    and bustle, it is difficult to develop new perspectives. One is so   busy  mop­ping up the water that one does not even think of turning off  the tap.\n\nIn order to get a grip   on  things at any time, your hands should be free. Being idle means to   have  time to do the right thing at the right moment.\n\nIV.\n\n**Inspiration.**  The Muses like idleness. To be kissed by the Muse is the pictorial  description of what many artists experience: a higher power seems to  guide the creative process. This process is more of a letting happen    than a conscious creation. Not the conscious ego - it paints, it writes,    it composes. This state is called Flow.\n\nIn  this way, making art becomes a communication with something unknown.  Are higher powers at work here? Or is it simply neurobiological  processes? Either way, it seems like a miracle.\n\nBut the flow does not come on command. You can only create good conditions for it. There's an an­cient Chinese story about that.\n\n*“A  wood carver carved a bell stand. When the bell stand was finished, all    the people who saw it were amazed at its divine work. The Prince of Lu    also looked at it and asked the Master, ‘What is your se­cret?’ The    latter replied, ‘I am a craftsman and know no secrets, and yet there is    one thing that matters. When I was about to make the bell stand, I  was   careful not to consume my life force in other thoughts. I fasted  to   bring my heart to rest. When I fasted for three days I no longer  dared   to think of reward and honour; after five days I no longer dared  to   think of praise and blame; after seven days I had forgotten my  body and   all my limbs. At that time I also no longer thought about the  court of   Your Highness. Thus I was collected in my art, and all  infatuations of   the outside world had dis­appeared. Afterwards I went  into the forest   and looked at the trees in their natural growth. When  the right tree   came before my eyes, the bell stand was ready in front  of me, so that I   only had to put my hand on it. If I had not found the  tree, I would  have  given up. Be­cause I let my nature interact with  the nature of the   material, that's why people think it's a divine  work.’"" (Zhuangzi,  XIX.10)*\n\n[Read more](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DYCKP39)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1j5b1frcsmi51.jpg?width=472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63735f4713ab76342077507bec03f98e76ae9ac9"

ifsb4i,"Regenerative Agriculture So whenever I see things posted about regenerative agriculture or about veganism, etc. this topic\nIf regenerative farming seems to pop up. And I think most people know that what happens is there is a group of people who say we need to eat less meat (less factory farming) and there is a group of people who says we can farm regeneratively and put carbon back in the soil. Then another group says this is not scalable and we shouldn’t be thinking about this, and keep the focus on eating less meat. Here is my question. Why are these two things (eating LESS meat overall, and farming in a regenerative manner) mutually exclusive. Why can’t we do both? Whether you eat meat or you are a vegan, wouldn’t you care about the quality of the soil and farming in a way that nourishes the land and soil, rather than strips it of nutrients? I don’t think the end game of regenerative farming has to be to raise more livestock but rather to regenerate the soil, because if we don’t, that means disaster for all the crops we are growing. Why did regenerative farming become sort of this buzzword for trying to eat more meat or anti-veganism? In my mind it’s more about the soil and the ecosystem. I would like the hear some thoughts"

It’s a pilot to try to create steel with a low CO2 footprint using hydrogen. \n\nPoints of discussion: \n\n* Is this greenwashing or a real step towards sustainability? \n* Production of Hydrogen costs a lot of energy (electricity). So, to make hydrogen sustainable the production of electricity will well need to be green first. For example, Tata Steel in the Netherlands has its own coal power plants, they produce a massive amount of CO2 and are exempt from the promise to close all coal plants in Holland by 2030. To generate hydrogen, for Tata Steel alone, all wind turbines in the North Sea, owned by The Netherlands will have to be used, just to produce hydrogen for Tata steel... \n* GGBS, the ultimate concrete greenwash product, will not be a side product anymore, forcing concrete producers to look for real sustainable concrete solutions?\n\nThoughts?"

ikl8ee,"Research advice TLDR: is doing a research project this year where I want to explore how batteries will shape energy infrastructure in Arizona and ease the proven drawbacks of solar panels.\n\nHello everyone! I am a senior university student about to begin a lengthy year long research project, the last thing required to graduate. My major is in sustainable architecture and built environments, which is a pretty general major where I focus mostly in real estate, energy and building design (I know, random, but I have a lot of interests in the field). The main idea in their major is engineers and other scientists from different fields come up with effective sustainable concepts and technology and people with my degree attempt to implement them in all different ways, particularly architecture and public planning. \n\nI have figured out my “research problem” generally but I am hoping to gain some specificity in what I am hoping to research. Here is generally what I have, I have also written a more formal problem statement for class but this is the gist of it: \n\nObviously fossil fuels are out of the question for sustainable, environmentally friendly grid electricity infrastructure. Nuclear, while the most efficient form an energy standpoint, is expensive and controversial in America. Hydroelectric dams and wind turbines are not really an option where I live (AZ) so I am looking into solar panels (PV) as a viable option for the area (tons of sunlight)\n\nSolar panels are somewhat cost effective and likely the best best bet for localized sustainable energy production in my area where currently the grid is 80% coal based production. Most solar panels available on the market, however have massive inefficiencies in their energy production and have potential for a land use issue when meeting needs for our current grid needs. This raise the importance of batteries, energy storage, to be used in conjunction with solar panels.\n\nI want to explore how batteries will shape future sustainable energy production and infrastructure in my area (southern Arizona). This is still pretty general and I was hoping some of you could help give some cool, currently important ideas for narrowing down my research. Again, I am not doing a technical major so this would be more about implementing the technology.\n\nThanks everyone."

Here's how you can help. If you live in EU, there is a Citizen's Initiative ongoing to increase the Carbon Tax to €100 per tonne by 2025. The benefit of this tax would go to supporting green and sustainable infrastructure and easing financial strain on lower income households. This is similar to the Carbon Fee &amp; Dividend idea in that money is taken from polluters and used to support lower social and economic household by lowering the taxes they pay.\n\nThis increase is going to happen anyway over the coming years. The idea with this ECI is to make change happen faster and boost the economy sooner. Currently, using the money from the Carbon Tax is not necessarily legislated to be put aside specifically for these aims. So if you're against taxes in general, this is a good way to make taxes that are inevitable work for you.\n\nYou can read more and sign here: https://www.stopglobalwarming.eu/\n\nIt takes 30 second to sign.

There is so much out there that it can feel paralyzing, but we cannot afford to wait for someone else to fix this - even if they are the ones that caused it.

As community, we gotta try to support the few songs being made that do share our considerate views. To help this music genre grow a bit,  I have made an '[eco-music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4FiR80dpvaFxKuDfDgrbRN?si=BTLXeA8SRROPHsM-lfv1ug)'  playlist on Spotify were we can support fellow artists spread the  message.

I’m currently an architecture student in a major city and I hate the environment. Everything we discuss has a focus on urban design and large commercial + residential structures. While this is an important sect of sustainable design, it’s not something I’m specifically interested in and I don’t see myself working in a large firm in a city. I have no interest in large, destructive structures, rather small and smart eco-friendly structures. I’m an advocate for living in nature, not destroying it to make space for cities and I want to find a school that can provide me with that perspective. Being self sufficient, minimalism, off the grid, permaculture, environmental sciences, etc. are interests of mine. Any ideas or advice?"

irid34,"Instead of melting plastics down to recycle them, wouldn't it be better to shred and glue them together similar to plywood? So plastics are a huge issue right now and especially since China  stopped accepting our plastics almost everything goes to the landfill.  Sorting and cleaning everything is also really expensive, and you can't  really mix the plastics because they have different melting points and  would solidify at different rates. Furthermore plastic strength degrades  each time they are occasionally recycled. I've been wondering for  awhile then, why isn't there a larger industry based around shredding  and gluing together plastics? You could mix the plastics, they wouldn't  have to be as clean, and in general it could be much cheaper. I guess  this too could have issue with not being able to be recycled that many  times, and you would only be able to create solid objects rather than  thin and flexible shapes."

itgggm,"Ways to up the Sustainability in your life I'm still a beginner, and I did not take particular interest in sustainability until about a year ago, so please feel free to correct me or make additional suggestions. \n\n1. Get rid of the beef and dairy: I eat plant based, and this is one of the best things I could do for the environment. All animal product production emits greenhouse gases, but these two are by far the worst. There are so many dairy and meat substitutes you can buy at your grocery store that are just as good. \n2. Reduct plastic consumption: out of all the waste you create, plastic is by far the worst. First of all its made from fossil fuels, and they don't biodegrade for 420 ish years. Eliminating all waste is impossible but the easiest ways to cut down on your plastic waste are: reusable coffee cups and water bottles, ask if products you buy cannot be wrapped in plastic, and dine in restaurants instead of take out. \n3. Take notes on an iPad: this one is weird. At first I thought all the electricity was bad the environment, but that pales in comparison to paper production. A full day's charge of an iPad is the same carbon emission as a single piece of paper (and there's no way you can put everything onto one sheet of paper in a day). I cannot be completely paperless but I take notes on an iPad to reduce the notes paper I use. Online school is great for this as most things I turn in are online so I don't even need to submit anything on paper. \n4. Be mindful of buying clothes: many clothing retailers come from fast fashion. Fast fashion wants you to continuously buy and throw out. Wear clothes until they completely wear out. And if you decide that you don't want to wear a piece of clothing anymore, donate it to your local goodwill or thrift store. And when you go a goodwill, look around and see what you like."

itizdl,"Tips for a family opposed to sustainability? How do I deal with a non-sustainable lifestyle? So I (22) lived in another Japan for a while. It was not the most sustainable by any means, but I lived on my own in that time, and found myself able to make things work. It took months, but I was actually doing quite well!\n\nThe hardest thing for me was having to leave during covid. Unfortunately, a series of terrible circumstances meant that I could not live there anymore, and I had to leave. *Everything*. *Shut. Down.* Any charity I was trying to get my stuff to wouldn't take it. I couldn't sell my stuff because of the pandemic. Any business that I could resell through was closed from a state of emergency. I couldn't take many things with me, as I couldn't afford to pay for extra suitcases, and it wasn't feasible to take some items. Even with recycling, I recycled what I could, but its very strict and specific there..some things just couldn't make it. As a result, I desperately sold and gave away what I could, and then tossed the rest. This has made me feel guilty, because it shouldn't have been that way, but it was. \n\nNow, I've moved back to the States, and due to the circumstances I am living with my parents. I get it..there are some things that during covid times make anyone uncomfortable. I no longer bring my reusable bags in for produce because the supermarket has asked me not to, and I cannot buy in bulk here (something I was excited to do because Japan didn't allow for bulk buying)...this is just one example.\n\nAt home, my parents are even more opposed. I've had to rebuy a lot of things I was forced to abandon in Japan, especially with many thrift stores in my area having been closed (I arrived in May) at the time. I always bring my own bags to the store, but my mother gets angry when I go buy something and do not bring home a plastic bag for her, because she likes to save them ""and reuse them as trash bags"". I purchased a coconut husk sponge, and it was thrown out because ""it might damage the pots"", even if it never had. It was replaced with a plastic sponge. Even with my own laundry, which I do myself, its a fight. I use wool dryer balls, and I'm accused of ""breaking the laundry"" because of the way they sound when tossed around. I've explained that this is not the case, but I'm never believed. I can't even compost anymore, because my parents think its gross to keep it all week to give to the farmer's market, even when I've tried suggesting we hit two farmer's markets a week to dump. All in all, this change in my lifestyle (which I understand isn't totally my fault, but I'm sure I've contributed to)  is causing me a lot of stress and mental health issues. I try where I can, but its all just very difficult for me.\n\nHow do I deal with my family and this non-sustainable situation? I'm hoping to get back on track as soon as I can move out, but I'm still working on getting a job."

itr2ic,"There’s Nothing Funny about 2020: Why I’m Releasing a Digital Comedy Show Rather Than Participating in Fashion Week. **There’s Nothing Funny about 2020:** \n\n**Why I’m Releasing a Digital Comedy Show Rather Than Participating in Fashion Week.**  \n\nBy Zero Waste Daniel\n\nIn mid-March, when New York’s non-essential business shutdown was first announced, I had already been on the hamster wheel of fashion for over a decade. Pandemic aside, a mandatory two week stopdown felt like a scary, but dare I say, welcomed change of pace. \n\nMaking and selling clothes out of upcycled fabric scraps in my Brooklyn storefront is a world away from holding down a corporate 9 to 5 job. It's more of an all-consuming obsession, that requires as many hours as it takes to get the job done everyday. So I thought that lowering the gate on my store for a few weeks, while I worked from home in an effort to ‘flatten the curve,’ would be completely manageable for me and my business. \n\nFor the first time since launching my brand, *Zero Waste Daniel*, I had some reserves to weather the storm. I finally had a direct to consumer business that was making consistent sales and getting some real buzz. I had just come off of my 4th, and largest, installment of my Fashion Week series, *Sustainable Fashion is Hilarious,* an unconventional fashion/comedy show, and my way of participating in Fashion Week, without participating in Fashion Week. Last season’s theme was “*The Death of Fashion*.” \n\nThe show featured models clad head to toe in my newest offerings, scattered throughout Arcadia Earth, a 15-room climate change museum. It wasn’t a runway or a presentation. It was a staged protest against greed, and a mock funeral for what it once meant to be a great fashion designer. The models were more than living hangers, they were activists. They marched back and forth with signs demanding to know, “Who killed fashion?”  In one room, they showed you how to make an apocalypse survival kit; in another, two model’s led a seance to conjure old trends. There was a guest book where people could leave their sympathies next to an altar covered in photos of great designers and brands gone too soon. Everyone *at* the show was *in* the show. *The Death of Fashion* was a whole mood that night. \n\nIn the final room, before guests left, in lieu of the customary designer’s bow, I read a eulogy for a comically long list of trends no longer considered *en vogue*. \n\nAs people passed through the exit, without being prompted, they began paying their last respects. Some jokingly hugged me and offered condolences. Others did so seriously.\n\nIt was a show, an event, a collection, a party, a performance, and one of our last nights out in New York before COVID-19 hit our city. For me, it was also a catharsis. That night, I let go of my hopes and expectations of what my future in fashion might hold.\n\nA few weeks later, I felt the first ripples of the pandemic. One day before the shutdown officially took effect, the owner of a sample room in Manhattan frantically called me. She told me that if I didn't come and pick up my unfinished goods within the hour, they would be padlocked inside the building indefinitely. \n\nI picked up the unfinished order. The next morning I went into autopilot. I put on a mask, went into my  workshop, and began to finish the job one piece at a time. The bulk of my next 2 weeks were not spent working from home, but in my closed store in front of a sewing machine attaching 600 patches to sweatshirts, while my husband, Mario, clipped threads and packed orders.\n\nWhile sewing those patches, I thought back to 2011. That year I was a new independent designer, who had just gotten my first large wholesale order.  I didn’t have the money to produce any goods up-front, nor was I doing the kind of volume that a factory would take on. Rather than cancel the order, I sat in my studio and sewed up 100 dresses myself. That time it was my mother who clipped the threads and packed the orders.\n\nNow in 2020, as I attached the final patches to my project, in my shut down store, in the middle of a pandemic that had already affected so many, so deeply...I felt a familiar feeling. \n\nIt was the need to survive. When I shipped that order in 2011, I felt like I had walked through a gauntlet. 2020 is a more complicated world with higher stakes. This time, I knew I could ship the order, that was the easy part. Now, I had to focus on things even more important than what happens next with my brand. This is about actual survival. \n\nSo what if I would never be a designer who shows their collections at Bryant Park or Lincoln Center. I no longer cared that I would never sell to Barney’s. They are the victims of the times. My sights have moved on from those outdated symbols of success. \n\nIn 2020, survival *is* success. And with an industry in flux and an uptick in “no new clothes” pledges and sustainability challenges, how do I design for people who are not buying?\n\nHow do you feed people who are full?\n\nYou don't. You entertain them. It’s the classic “dinner and a movie.” People are stuffed to the gills with clothing, but they’re hungry for entertainment. “More content please!” From tik tok tutorials to reality tv, consumers want fashion all over their screens. The demands of design are evolving. This season’s push towards digital is the perfect time for me to get my show out of fashion week altogether and into a new format where it can reach more people, make more change, do more good, and create less waste.  \n\nThe show *is* the product. This collection will be a hybrid series, a mix of clothing and content for sale.\n\nTickets for the first show will be released later this week, and the clothing in it will follow. It won’t be just for New Yorkers or fashion people, but for anyone, anywhere, who’s looking for a little entertainment and a laugh.  And if you do find yourself with a craving for clothing, I'm still here surviving and making sweatshirts and joggers out of scraps.\n\n\- Daniel\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwww.zerowastedaniel.com"

Google was not as helpful as usual, so I tried my best.\n\n**Key points:**\n\n* **Perchlorate is dangerous.** It ""prevents the thyroid from absorbing iodine, which the gland needs to produce hormones that are critical for brain development""\n* **Only California and Massachusetts limit the amount of perchlorate in drinking water.** ""The Environmental Protection Agency has so far found the chemical in 45 states, tainting water supplies of roughly 16 million Americans. It has been found in the bodies of every single American who has been tested for it.""\n* **Utilities companies don't have to let you know if perchlorate is in your tap water.** A few things: vulnerable populations don't know to take steps to reduce their exposure. Also common household filters don't remove chemicals. ALSO bottled water is basically just tap water (we've learned this before in a previous edition), so you might be paying for perchlorate in your water. Since perchlorate is unregulated outside CA and MA, it doesn't have to be removed from bottled water.\n* **The Safe Drinking Water Act says chemicals are assumed safe until proved otherwise.** Yeah. Read it again.\n* **0 new drinking water contaminants have been regulated in the past 20 years.** Out of the 85,000+ chemicals I mentioned earlier, only 89 have EVER been restricted by federal regulation.\n\nThe Bush Administration's EPA also tested perchlorate on human subjects. The study had ethical and logistical concerns and only tracked effects over two weeks. Industry players have been exploiting scientific uncertainties in perchlorate studies as well, stalling the creation of regulation.\n\nYup, this was one of the most appalling articles I've read in a while. [And in June 2020](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-issues-final-action-perchlorate-drinking-water), the current administration's EPA decided that they would - surprise - still not regulate perchlorate.\n\n**What now?**\n\nI wrote up some ideas in greater length in my [newsletter](https://www.soapboxproject.org/archives/water-pollution) but here are some:\n\n \n\n* [Test your water.](https://mytapscore.com/products/perchlorate-water-test) \n* **Ask your city or county representative** what they're planning to do about safe drinking water for you and your neighbors.\n* Get [perchlorate water filters](https://waterful.org/best-perchlorate-water-filter/)."

I was laid off in May due to covid and have been seizing this as an opportunity to finally get into the industries that I actually care about. I've spent every day since networking and applying and have not had any interviews yet. I'm trying my best not to lose hope but I'm definitely feeling discouraged, especially with my parents breathing down my neck to just get any old job already. My LinkedIn profile and resume are solid - I've had a lot of assistance from a career coach.\n\nMy degree is mechanical engineering. I had a short research stint in solar cells, 2 yrs of automotive manufacturing, and 1 yr in industrial gas operations. I worked my ass off for that research job, thinking it would set the foundation for my career, but every semester it was just a rush to get any job. The only exposure my university provided to environment-related engineering was waste/water treatment for municipalities.\n\nEvery job I see I'm either drastically overqualified or underqualified for, or just not qualified for at all. Yes, I am still applying for these jobs anyway because I know I have plenty of transferable skills. I've looked into companies in all parts of the supply chain, such as Vestas and Siemens Gamesa, to Orsted, to DNV GL and NextEra, etc. I've transitioned my search to companies such as Pyrolyx and TerraCycle and electric vehicles. I just don't know what else to do anymore. Why is it so hard to just get my foot in the door? \n\nI'm hoping for recommendations on places to apply, recruiting companies that might specialize in these industries, or even just words of advice or encouragement."

I have been working on an ongoing project for almost 5 years now nick-named [“[Signs of collapse]”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.\n\nI try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.\n\nI define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.\n\nI’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.\n\nFeel free to share any of the material or repost this on other suitable subreddits.

j3kx9d,"Which form of carbon pollution is worse for the environment? Im a chemistry undergrad with an interest in recycling processes. I was doing some web surfing on plastic recycling and came across this study. \n\nhttps://www.ijntr.org/download_data/IJNTR03070029.pdf\n\nThe paper outlines the process of synthesizing petroleum products from plastic waste. Plastic is synthesized from petroleum in the first place so its not hard to imagine that its possible to reverse engineer it back into natural gas, but it got me thinking about which form of carbon would be more harmful to the environment. \n\nNow realistically, natural gas from plastic waste would be used to fill the global demand for petroleum, reducing the volume of oil mining worldwide. This would lead to at least a temporary slowing of overall carbon pollution in the world if we factor in both carbon dioxide and plastic. So for the sake of comparison, lets assume that any natural gas produced from plastic waste would be burned IN ADDITION TO the amount of fresh petroleum currently used to fill the global demand. Imagine converting all plastic waste into petroleum, putting it in a giant hole, and just burning it with no purpose. From an environmental standpoint, which do you think would be more harmful: Plastic waste in the environment or increased greenhouse gas levels caused by converting all plastic waste to carbon dioxide? \n\nHypothetically, if we were able to remove all of the plastic waste polluting the oceans and other ecosystems and turn it into carbon dioxide, would there be a net increase or decrease in damage to the global ecosystem?\n\nSecondly, if we were able to collect all plastic pollution out of the environment, would it be better to convert it to carbon dioxide or collect it all neatly in a landfill?"

It seemed cool in theory (in my head) but I constantly feel like the idea is unnecessarily taxing (and perhaps not truly closing the loop).

I didn't find any rules about politics, so I wanted to share this summary I made about the Joe Biden climate plan. It's taken from [my newsletter](https://www.soapboxproject.org) but in the interest of not self-promoting I wanted to copy the whole thing here to share with you.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat’s covered: \n\n* *READ: the good and the bad of Joe Biden’s climate plan*\n* *LISTEN: the economics of the Green New Deal, which the Biden plan was unofficially modeled off of*\n* *ACT: 3 ways to hold our politicians accountable*\n* *REFLECT: An interview with a former climate change denier*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n# READ: Highs and lows of Joe Biden's Climate Plan\n\nThis month's Changeletter is going to be on the Biden campaign's climate plan. I was initially going to include an impartial look at both candidates' takes on the matter, but... only Biden has a take, really. I guess it's technically still impartial.\n\nA quick note about before we start: I don't believe news can truly ever be ""neutral"". I do, however, *curate* the content in these newsletters without *creating* or finding facts of my own, so I hope this will be an informative, """"impartial"""" overview of the Biden climate plan: good, bad, and what we can do to continue holding the campaign accountable - especially if Biden is elected and the plan becomes reality.\n\n**Remember to vote by mail as early as possible if your state allows it and please,** [**please check**](http://vote.org/) **that you're registered to vote. It's extra important to make sure your non-internet-using family members are registered too - even if you disagree with their beliefs.** I've also [signed up to text bank](https://joebiden.com/link/text-for-joe/) for the Biden campaign and I also joined the [NAACP Civic Engagement](https://www.naacp.org/civicengagement/) program which took \~20 seconds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Alt: Does the $2 trillion plan that promises a carbon-free electric power grid by 2035 take the necessary steps to fight climate change? ](https://preview.redd.it/rbs09hz4qbr51.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d770446b9d99806b0f8bde33b173a486eb9b526)\n\n \n\n## JOE’S HOT TAKE\n\nHere, I'll lay out some positives of the $2 trillion (yes, TRILLION) climate plan, what it's missing, and who's involved. I'll let you decide on your own if it's #MoMoneyMoProblemz or if the plan will get us where we need to be.\n\nFirst, a random fact: ""Climate"" is mentioned only 28 times and ""jobs"" is mentioned 53 times. Joe's trying to position this as more of a jobs bill than a climate bill - he's actually linking economic recovery from COVID times to fighting climate change. Let's hope it works and creates a win-win!\n\n[RollingStone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/joe-biden-climate-plan-green-new-deal-1041741/) gives a pretty good overview of the plan and its drawbacks:\n\n### THE GOOD \n\n* a carbon-free electric power grid by 2035\n* providing cities with a population of 100,000 or more with zero-emissions public transportation like light rail, electric buses, and infrastructure for bicyclists\n* creating 1 million new jobs in the U.S. auto industry by incentivizing the switch from internal-combustion engines to electric-powered vehicles\n* upgrading 4 million buildings and weatherizing 2 million homes for energy efficiency\n* pledging that disadvantaged communities would receive 40 percent of the overall benefits of spending on clean-energy and infrastructure upgrades\n\n### THE BAD\n\n* **Silent on fracking**, presumably because fracking is ""beneficial"" to economic recovery. But the costs of fracking are often borne by communities of color\n* **Focus on technology over political power:** it's not clear how power will be redistributed to communities of color, who disproportionately face the impacts of climate change and are disenfranchised from the decision-making process\n* **No mention on carbon price.** ""Most economists agree that dealing with the climate crisis in a serious and transformative way requires legislation that puts a price on carbon... Biden’s plan, for obvious political reasons, is silent on what kind of carbon price he might support, or, more important, how much political muscle he will be willing to exert to get one.""\n\n### THE PEOPLE\n\nI'll let you read this article from [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2020/08/07/joe-biden-climate-policy-advisers/), but... some of Joe Biden's climate advisors embrace fossil fuels and fracking. The $2T commitment is great, but when it comes down to it, the administration is going to need someone to hold it accountable. Biden's advisors may not be up to the task.\n\nBut we (\* gestures at readers \*) are!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n# LISTEN: The Joe Biden Green New Deal?\n\nYou might recall that I'm not a climate wonk; I'm just a wonky millennial trying to understand how we can do our part to fight climate change. So today, we're doing a little climate #throwback.  \n\n\nWe're going to talk about the Green New Deal.  \n\n\nThis week, for the second module of September, I'm sharing a 4-minute video that explains the basics of GND economic spending. It's critical that all of us as voters understand what we're getting into - politically, economically, and socially. GND basics are important as a framework, because although he hasn't actually said it, Biden's climate plan has a lot in common with the GND.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ktx33s8bqbr51.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d2f914fe58def28d8622a812a697405a903a897\n\n Rhiana Gunn-Wright, the policy lead for the Green New Deal, debunks the notion that it will cost taxpayers $93 trillion. I highly recommend you watch the [full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVyMfBpEZuA&amp;ab_channel=TheYEARSProject) here. It's only 4 minutes and it'll give you some ammunition to talk to folks who think climate investment is too expensive. \n\n[https://youtu.be/uVyMfBpEZuA](https://youtu.be/uVyMfBpEZuA)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nIf you don't have time to watch it right now, here are 3 things I learned from the video:\n\n* Deep decarbonization is estimated to save $5 trillion in the long run &amp; grow the economy 2.5x  \n \n* In 2018, NASA saw the American economy lost $91 billion just from climate change (I'm unable to find that statistic on NASA's website but here's [something from Yale](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2019/04/climate-change-could-cost-u-s-economy-billions/) that estimates $224 billion annual losses by 2090)  \n \n* One reason costs compound is because of how much $ it takes to simply patch up disasters. Think of our current approach as *really* expensive duct tape.\n\nAfter watching the [4-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVyMfBpEZuA&amp;ab_channel=TheYEARSProject), you'll be prepared to tell your friendly neighborhood fiscal conservative that spending money on green infrastructure **saves** money, **grows** the economy, and will in fact be **one of the main drivers** of the global economy.\n\nIf you're craving more, here's a 3-min video by [Grist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcQZtpbgVoY&amp;ab_channel=Grist) that goes into some more detail about what the GND contains.\n\n*P.S. - I highly recommend* [*refreshing your knowledge*](https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/new-deal) *on the original New Deal and some of its biggest wins and pitfalls.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n# ACT: 3 ways to prepare for the election and beyond\n\nThe Read + Listen two modules highlight how complex any climate plan is bound to be. Overall, though, this plan *is* ambitious. The question is: will it actually be implemented if we have a Biden Administration?\n\nBonus action: we have to have a Biden Admin in the first place for any of this to vote. If you believe that too, you can [sign up to text bank](https://www.mobilize.us/joebiden/event/228909/). I signed up a few days ago and it's super straightforward.\n\nAnyway, for this to happen, we need to **hold politicians accountable** on a national and local level.  \n \n\nThese actions are simple but they mean a lot. **Please do at least one:**  \n \n\n1. [**Join Sunrise Movement.**](https://www.sunrisemovement.org/take-action/) It's a political action group for young people (sub-35) who care about the environment. You can attend trainings, phone bank, and organize your community. The Sunrise Movement was a key player in pushing for Joe Biden's climate plan - proof that organizing your community works.  \n \n2. **Vote... on local legislation.** State and local policies are critical to national climate leadership. You can click on the map to learn more about why, but if you're a policy nerd and you want to understand what states are actually *doing*, [read this](https://www.c2es.org/content/state-climate-policy/). If you live in California and want some guidance on how to vote, here's an [Environmental Justice Voter Guide for 2020.](http://ceja-action.org/ej-voter/voterguide/)  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rno69xqiqbr51.png?width=1419&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f63891cd0979e7004a79bcd3c4518e28e3b171dc\n\n \n\nI also recommend you bookmark [Govtrack](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/), which keeps track of bills that go through Congress.  \n\n\n**3. Be in touch with your politicians.** You can find your elected officials in many places; [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Who_represents_me) is likely a good place, though, because then you can find local legislation too. I follow San Francisco supervisors on Twitter and it's fantastic. For the first time in my life, I finally know what's going on on a local level. There's still room for improvement, but it's a great start.\n\nAlso, idea for anyone looking for a tech side project: build a politician promise tracker. All over the internet, people are giving advice like ""reference your politicians' promises"", but I can't find a single tool that looks helpful... other than in [Kyrgyzstan](https://internews.org/updates/promise-tracking-website-holds-politicians-accountable-public-kyrgyzstan).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n# REFLECT: 3 insights from an ex-climate change denier\n\nMegan Brown is a registered Republican and rancher who lives in Butte County, a conservative area of Northern California that was decimated by the 2018 Camp Fire. I was actually up there in 2018 during the fires - it was... mind-boggling to meet people who had lost everything yet still refused to believe in human-made climate change.  \n \n\nAnyway, here's three highlights from an interview between Megan and Slate. You can find the full interview [here.](https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/09/california-wildfires-climate-change-skeptics-farmers-ranchers.html)  \n \n\nI hope this helps some of you find a silver lining as we navigate politicization of crises!  \n\n\n### ON DENYING CLIMATE CHANGE...\n\n*When you were a climate change denier, how did you see what was happening in the world? I’m curious about your path, because I don’t know that I’ve ever talked to anyone who’s changed their mind about climate change.*\n\nI assumed the Earth is probably always changing and heating up and cooling and that’s normal. And then, more science was presented. The fires happened. I had to take a moment, take a deep breath, go to people that were smarter than me and listen to the science and listen to them. I’m a firm believer now.\n\n### ON BEING UNABLE TO USE THE WORDS ""CLIMATE CHANGE"" IN CONVERSATIONS...\n\n*So what do you say instead of* ***climate change?***\n\nYou just blame it on each thing. It’s like, oh, the fires, oh, the grasshoppers. I’m hoping they’re going to start connecting the dots in their own head and then, in a year or two, I can use the term *climate change*. But we’ll see.\n\n### ON SUCCESS...\n\n*What would success look like when talking to these politicians, and what are you hoping they’ll propose?*\n\nI’m not really asking for much right now. I’m just asking them to acknowledge it’s a thing that’s happening. If I could get that, I think that’d be just a great starting point: *Man-made climate change exists*.  \n \n\nAgain, you can read the full article [here](https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/09/california-wildfires-climate-change-skeptics-farmers-ranchers.html).  \n\nIf you liked this read, [get our newsletter](https://www.soapboxproject.org) straight to your inbox.

For my senior project I want to tackle the problem of dealing with food waste whether on a personal (home) scale or on a larger scale and how we can use it for other means other than compost. I wanted to learn more from some of you guys here. I am mainly looking for people who experts or knowledgeable on the subject, but any information is a great help. It may even lead me to design around a new subject in sustainability.  The subject is not set in stone. Please Let me know if I could do a quick 10-minute interview with you. \n\nThank You!"

j77xi3,"30-Sec Summary of Exxon's Plan to INCREASE CO2 Emissions  \n\nThe following is taken from this [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-05/exxon-carbon-emissions-and-climate-leaked-plans-reveal-rising-co2-output) report and this [Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/05/leaked-documents-reveal-exxonmobil-plans-to-increa/) article (I recommend reading the Bloomberg one). Both articles reference a leaked Exxon internal document.\n\nExxon put out a press release claiming that the Bloomberg report is misleading, but I think I'll take my chances and stand by this report. You can read Exxon's statement [here](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/News/Newsroom/News-releases/2020/1005_ExxonMobil-statement-regarding-inaccurate-Bloomberg-news-story).\n\n‍\n\n* **Exxon has an ambitious plan... to increase fossil fuel production.** Their own assessment of their $210 billion investment strategy shows yearly CO2 emissions rising 17% by 2025. Yes, *rising*.  \n‍\n* **Exxon wants to compete with Greece, I guess?** This ""ambitious"" plan would increase their annual emissions by as much as the output of the ENTIRE NATION of Greece. That's a whole country!  \n‍\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v3qc2drmbtr51.png?width=4320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c55536afc488fb9aafe3a4e9f891f1b53251c71a\n\n* **The number is an underestimate.** Basically, Exxon wants to ramp up oil production. This would *increase* CO2 emissions by 21 million metric tons by 2025. This doesn't account for what they already emit. (Emission, more like omission, amirite?) Exxon's leaked documents estimate total emissions of 143 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2025.  \n‍\n* **They're trying to sneak past you.** They talk big game about their emissions reduction strategy, but that's to distract you from the fact that they emit WAY more than they reduce — the reduction is likely just a publicity play at this time.\n\n‍\n\nThere's good news, though. Plus, more info on the history of this colossal problem. Sources are linked if you want to learn more.\n\n‍\n\n* **There's good news!** Exxon's competitors, like Shell and BP, have [committed](https://fortune.com/2020/04/16/net-zero-emissions-shell-oil-industry-gas/) to net-zero emissions targets by 2050 because of shareholder demands. Putting pressure on corporations works and it's one of the best ways we can take action as individuals. I'm here to show you how.  \n‍\n* **Only 20 companies have contributed to a third of all CO2 emissions.** Yeah, [here's the list.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/09/revealed-20-firms-third-carbon-emissions)  \n[‍](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/09/revealed-20-firms-third-carbon-emissions)\n* **We let this happen because of** [**politics**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesellsmoor/2019/06/15/united-states-spend-ten-times-more-on-fossil-fuel-subsidies-than-education/#5ffb994c4473) **and capitalism**.

j8m0py,"[Discussion] Sustainability of chalkboards vs. whiteboards I was thinking about schools moving into the future and the materials being used to teach children and got me thinking... seems like whiteboards + markers is a very disposable solution to a problem that has already been solved with chalk + chalkboards.\n\nChalk comes in paper boxes, and has a relatively high percent of product (usable chalk) that can fit in a volume for shipping. Compared to markers, which come in plastic tubes, that are packaged with more plastic. And markers dont seem as durable either. Markers can fail if they become dried out, and are just in general more disposable. Chalkboads can't really get stained by chalk, compared to whiteboards that get stained by dry erase ink. Plus chalkboards are easy to clean, all you need is a mop and some water to get it looking brand new. The university I went to had many chalkboards multiple times as old as I am.\n\nThe only negative thing I can think of is the resources it takes to manufacture chalk + chalkboard paint, which even seems less energy + resource intensive than manufacturing whiteboards, markers, and ink.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?"

j9dcab,"Looking into ways to reduce my plastic waste, any suggestions for food products with no plastic packaging? I'm looking into trying to find ways to use less plastic without giving up a whole lot of the life I've become accustomed to, since I'm pretty sure I'll be more likely to keep that up. So, I'm using disposable bamboo utensils for those days/events I don't feel like doing dishes, trying to find brands that use cardboard/glass/metal packaging rather than plastic. My goal isn't to really reduce my waste, but to produce waste that is either sustainably and realistically recycled or biodegradable. \n\nSo I'm looking for suggestions for food brands that use sustainable packaging, since the food industry is rife with plastic. Preferably ones that have online stores that ship to the US, since it's kind of a toss up whether small or specialty brands will be in a supermarket near me. Mainly looking for snacks and jarred or dry goods, since I'm trying to get my perishables from local farmers markets. Extra bonus points if they're certified humane. No restrictions on diet.\n\nRice and bread are especially hard to find in anything other than plastic bags near me. And it's hard to tell if things like cereals or crackers use plastic or wax paper liners from the shelf. I've definitely had a cereal that looked like it used a wax paper liner, but I can't remember the brand. And if anyone has a veggie or sweet potato chip that's plastic free, *please* do share. I *love* Terra brand, but their bags feel like they use plastic.\n\nSome suggestions I've found:\n\n* Cabot cheeses use wax paper instead of plastic and are pretty found consistently in the US as far as I'm aware. Nonrecyclable, but biodegradable. \n* Any canned drink rather than plastic bottles, since cleaned aluminum and cardboard are easier to recycle or biodegradable. Glass bottles are great, too, but I think everyone knows that.\n* True paper plates instead of styrofoam or plastic. EverSpring is a pressed paper plate that's heavy duty and microwavable. But even the cheaper flimsy wax paper plates are better in my book. Nonrecyclable, but biodegradable. \n* Timofey bamboo disposable utensils are relatively affordable and look nice for parties. Nonrecyclable, but biodegradable. \n\nThat's about all I've got that's solid, besides that things that normally come in glass jars/cans like soups, canned veggies, and pasta sauces. I don't get preserved fruits often, but I definitely opt for canned instead of the plastic fruit cups, I guess. \n\nFeel free to let me know if I'm mistaken or missing something about any of my suggestions! Thanks in advanced!"

Not saying everyone has to be vegan, but meat in general uses a lot of resources and cutting back in general would be more sustainable. Meat is pretty cheap, however, which makes it difficult for people to understand that it's better for the earth to have a plant based system that would utilize less resources. Wouldn't meat be crazy expensive if it used so many more resources? \n\nI'm wondering if anyone has done some kind of cost analysis that shows what meat would actually cost if there were not subsidies placed on it, and/or comparing the price of plant-based alternatives if more vegetables were subsidized at the level the meat industry is."

jbv3si,"Sustainability Strategists for Moonshot Are you an innovator or a strategist with an interest in sustainability? \n\nI’m forming a community for those that want to figure out how we will achieve sustainability within a 10-year timespan by creating effective strategies, today. I’m currently looking for people willing to pioneer this ambitious concept.\n\nIf you’re a strategist, then you know that no organization can achieve goals without some type of plan. Now, the organization called “humanity” needs for us to combine forces to create effective strategies for achieving the goal of making our world more sustainable.\n\nThe idea is that we can create one, unifying, strategic plan that can be developed and followed by anyone that wants to opt-in. Starting small, the plan grows as we collectively decide which way we’re heading and how. This will create the effect of giving us some direction and guidance that we can test and refine over time until we **achieve our goals.**\n\nThis is a moonshot, by far. Or, if you prefer, it’s an “earth shot.” However, if we humans are ever going to overcome the great challenges we face, it’s going to have to be together. Our disjointed systems and uncoordinated efforts are not working, and so it makes sense that we have a unifying plan of action to get to our goals in the least amount of time possible. \n\nIf this interests you because you’re someone that wants to see the problem solved, and are willing to put mental energy into seeing that it happens, I’d love to chat. I’m looking for those that have skills or an interest in strategy. Tons of experience is not necessary at this point, it’s more about curiosity. \n\nI’m open to answering any questions so feel free to ask them. You can send a PM if you wish. \n\nThanks!"

I admit I am very ignorant of the many politics, details, complications, etc. involved in creating a sustainable future. I am also very ignorant of the many politics, complications, details, etc. in the Native American communities of today. My question is also a very naive question coming from a place of hope and (likely) idealism. \n\n*However*, from what little I know about the traditional lifestyle of Native American culture (pre-European influence and impact) and their philosophies regarding the planet and nature. (I am referring to how many Native American tribes tried to live in a way that respects nature and all that it gives. See this dissertation by Mary Magoulick: https://faculty.gcsu.edu/custom-website/mary-magoulick/worldview.htm) I would think that the people involved in sustainability organizations could greatly benefit from not only studying how the Native Americans used nature to supply for their day-to-day needs and adapting them to the needs of today but also involving the Native American communities in creating a more sustainable future. \n\nHow the Ancestral Pueblo peoples used the yucca plant is a great example of how studying the Native Americans lived could create a more sustainable future. The Pueblo people used all parts of the yucca plant for different purposes which can easily be adapted to today. For example, the yucca plant provided fibers used for rope, twine, baskets, and sandals. The roots of the yucca plant can be used as soap or shampoo. The fruit of the yucca plant can be eaten as well. (Source: https://www.nps.gov/band/learn/historyculture/native-plant-use.htm)\n\nA collaboration between organizations involved in creating a more sustainable future (like university departments or non-profits) and the different tribes of Native Americans interested in sustainability could create some positive changes for both communities. If collaboration is not realistic, then researching and contacting the Native American communities could generate new ideas for a more sustainable future.\n\nAgain, I am very ignorant of the politics and complexities that would be required in a collaboration or involving the Native American communities. I just want to discuss the topic and see what others have to say about it.\n\nHere are some other sources that also lend credence to this idea:\nhttps://www.epa.gov/green-building-tools-tribes\nhttps://www.narf.org/about-us/environmental-sustainability/"

I have an idea of starting a sustainable fitness clothing line since there isn't really one that stands out from another when it comes to just clothing made for working out in the gym.  With the rise of Gymshark and other fitness brands, none of them are sustainable and are all fast-fashion. \n\nHere are my concern and question, do I redesign/design a totally different garment made especially for sustainability, or do I simply change up the fabrics for garments from Gymshark and such, which I'm sure there are manufacturers that can do that.  A lot of activewear brands are all almost the same and very easy to replicate....lululemon is what stood out to me the most.  So I can't decide whether to just change the fabrics of what already exists and create a brand around it or design a completely new garment using Gymshark and other bigger brands as inspirations.  If I were to design then I'd need to invest in designers, pattern makers, tech pack specialists,s and such.  \n\nI'm willing to do all that I can to make this work and any suggestions anyone can give is highly appreciated.\n\nAlso, Let me know what you think about sustainable clothing for the gym!:)\n\nThank you for your time!"

jex03x,"Ecopin - a social media platform with an environmental focus launches on kickstarter! Ecopin is my concept for a social media platform that incorporates a ""social mapping system"" to encourage social media users to go out and participate in their local community. The social map allows users to create and view ""pins"" on a local map. These pins include everything going on in the community, from farmers markets to protests. The two goals of this mapping system are to make users aware of environmental threats that are hidden in their local community and  strengthen local communities through the creation and increased turnout to local events. That being said, it would not be wise to release an app like this during a pandemic, so for now we are focusing on the development on the app so it can hopefully be finished when things are finally going back to normal (who knows when that will be.)\n\nThe second part of the app is a normal social media platform like any other, but the difference is that Ecopin will care for it's users, and not exploit them. There will be no spying or selling of private information, divisive behavior will be extremely discouraged and there will be a large focus on preventing trolls and fake accounts from getting in. Another difference is that while advertisement will exist, it will only be for local and green businesses, unlike other social platforms that give advertisement to the highest bidder (no greenwashing allowed.)\n\n[Here is the landing page with information on the project](http://ecopin.org/index.html)\n\n[Here is the interactive design prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/d4c3249e-8164-48e8-4274-17fae90cd18e-a2f2/screen/a94a6981-1911-4297-84a5-491dcb08fbfb/?fullscreen)\n\n[and here is the kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1870061924/ecopin?ref=discovery&amp;term=ecopin)\n\nI decided to kickstart the project because I need to gather a motivated team of programmers, designers, environmental experts and team leaders. I gathered a small group of programmers passionate about the environment and interested in the project and we managed to start the prototyping process, but all of them have full time jobs and could only dedicate so much time to the project.

jf221d,"Privatization of Responsibility vs Being Consumers (I've spent about half an hour finding the right subreddit for this...I hope this *is* the right one...)\n\nI'm having difficulty even formulating my point in my own head, let alone putting it into writing, so I hope I can get it across. Basically, I'm torn between two stances on individual responsibility for sustainability. On the one hand, I think large companies are shifting responsibility for environmentally and socially sustainable behavior on the customer to absolve themselves of any responsibility. On the other hand, those companies are only existing *because* we give them our money. So aren't we ultimately responsible for what they're doing?\n\nOne [Tweet](https://twitter.com/NurseRyanFL/status/1316434774131605505) I saw today put it this way: \n\n&gt;Just a reminder that BP created and popularized the idea of individuals having a “carbon footprint” to make us forget that 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global CO2 emissions\n\nOn the one hand, yea, I really shouldn't feel too guilty about my personal ""carbon footprint"", considering only 100 companies produce 71% of all emissions. On the other hand, those 100 companies don't produce products for Martians, do they? By buying their products, we are responsible for their emissions.\n\nOr to use another, more personal example that has been bothering me recently: We have both a Néspresso and a Special.T (basically Néspresso for tea) machine. I especially love the latter, it has been a birthday present and I've been using it every day.  \nIt comes with guilt though. I know Néstle is the textbook example of a ruthless, capitalist company, and especially those two capsule machines are anything but sustainable. Isn't it my responsibility as a consumer to boycott Néstle in general and this product in particular? If nobody bought them, they wouldn't make them.  \nOn the other hand, why should it be my responsibility as a consumer to basically audit a company's business practices and implement sanctions against them? Isn't it up to my government to provide a legal framework that prevents companies from exploiting slave labor, and am I not paying companies partially to make sure their production methods and products are both environmentally and socially sustainable? Why should *I* put in the effort to screen my purchases and renounce my little luxuries, in short, bare the negative consequences of a company's actions?\n\nAm I making sense? I'm really not trying to straw-manning either side here. I genuinely stand on *both* sides of the argument simultaneously. On the one hand, I am a consumer and companies produce products for me to consume. If I don't consume, they don't produce. On the other hand, why should I responsible for problems that companies and lawmakers are aware of and are refusing to fix?"

jf8y41,"Colonialism in the Sustainable Development Goals: Critiquing land ""ownership"", and exploring other relationships to land. **Colonial relationships to land and their presence in the “sustainability” discourse and goal-setting:**\n\n\nSustainable Development Goal 1.4 refers to ""ownership and control"" of land, ""and other forms of property"". Here’s the full text:\n\n\n&gt; “Goal 1.4: By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance” (United Nations, 2017, p. 26).  \n \n \nArguably, this framing reduces land to property, and the relationship to land as one of ownership – a colonial way of thinking. It then universalizes this way of thinking to all cultures and peoples – presumably from an implicit assumption that this is the only way, or the best way, to think of, and relate to, land and our greater environment. Here are three quotes on that:\n\n\nFrom a paper critiquing the SDGs:\n\n\n&gt; Moreton-Robinson (2014), an Indigenous scholar located in Australia, argues that a logic of possession underpins colonialism. She demonstrates how Australia was socially and culturally constructed by the European settler-colonizers as a white possession, the logic of which was indelibly marked by race and subsequently became embedded in many settler nation’s immigration laws as a means to regulate and keep out non-White populations. (Pirbhai-Illich &amp; Martin, 2019, p. 24)\n\n\nA direct quote from Moreton-Robinson, referenced in the previous excerpt:\n\n\n&gt; Underpinning property rights, possession entails values, beliefs, norms, and social conventions as well as legal protection as it operates ideologically, discursively, and materially. Property rights are derived from the Crown, which in the form of the nation-state holds possession. Possession and nationhood are thus constituted symbiotically. This leads me to ask whether the form of Britishness and national identity that developed in Australia is “free of, uninformed, and unshaped by” Indigenous sovereignty. In this chapter, I explore how the core values of Australian national identity are located within the house that Jack built, a nation that in its denial of Indigenous sovereignty is perceived to be a white possession. (Moreton-Robinson, 2015, p. 20).\n\n\nAnd here’s a relevant quote from another paper about decolonization and the sustainable development goals that addresses this issue too:\n\n\n&gt; “…Patrick Wolfe (1999) emphasizes that settler colonialism is a structure and not an event. In the process of settler colonialism, land is remade into property and human relationships to land are restricted to the relationship of the owner to his property. Epistemological,  ontological, and cosmological relationships to land are interred, indeed made pre-modern and backward. Made savage. (Tuck &amp; Wang, 2012, p. 5)\n\n\n**Alternative relationships to land:**\n\nAs just one example of different relationships, we could consider many Australian Indigenous peoples beliefs and ways of being – and how they relate to land and ‘country’. Here’s another relevant quote that is best read in the fuller context of the whole paper, but still on its own provides a good overview:\n\n\n&gt; *Yapa* people identify so closely with country that they ‘are’ country. This logic means *yapa* are in relationship with everything in country: *warlalja* includes kinship to people, places, and things. Put differently, plants, animals, rocks, and so on, can all have skinnames. *Yapa* do not aim to dominate these other things: derivation of ngurrajinta from ngurra reflects that one’s relationships are all *through* and *because of* country, and because one *shares a relationship with* country beings. Rather, ‘emphasis [is] placed on shared identity [through ngurra] with others as a basis for social interaction’ (Myers 1988; also Dousset 2013). Because one is in relationship with these things and places, one has obligations to them all. This is law. (Patrick &amp; Spiers-Williams, 2018, p. 147)\n\n\n(Note on terms: Yapa literally means ‘people’; often used to mean only ‘Warlpiri people’, in context it can mean ‘Aboriginal people’ in continental Australia. The term ‘ngurra’ has multiple meanings best explained in the full paper, but a quick, oversimplified “translation” is that it refers to country, and the laws and ways of being that stem from it)\n\n\nImportantly, the idea of owning country doesn’t really make sense in this way of being in and knowing the world. That is not to say that the idea of ownership is totally alien either – but that it is understood very differently when country and its beings (plants, rocks, waters) are connected to personhood and identity; considered kin and an extension of self and ancestor. Ownership in that sense takes on a quite different meaning to the colonial term, and I have doubts that “ownership and control” as outlined in the SDGs reflects that – or leaves space for it. \n\n\n**Reconciling these differences:**\n\n\nEven though they critique the SDGs, the authors of the first quote (Pirbhai-Illich &amp; Martin) don’t write them off completely. Instead, they suggest that practioners and educators in this space are mindful of the biases inherent to them:\n\n\n&gt; So although we see the potential of SDG 4.7 to support the development of an education for sustainability that is alternative to the modernist and othering constructions evident in many of the SDGs, because it is tied to the neoliberal agenda of monitoring and measurement of quality, it requires educators who are tasked with implementing it to be critically aware of the discourses outlined above and how they reflect a continuing coloniality of thought. (Pirbhai-Illich &amp; Martin, 2019, p. 23)\n\n\nIn a similar vein, Steve Patrick (aka Wanta Jampijinpa Pawu-Kurlpurlurnu), author of the quote above about alternative relationships to land, eventually arrives at what progress can look like when these “two worlds” are reconciled properly, citing a range of Indigenous voices, but also a well-known Australian anthropologist’s words from over half a century ago.\n\n\n&gt; The reality of life in Lajamanu is that Warlpiri culture is being overwhelmed by a pervasive and powerful Euro-Australian culture. Wanta argues that ngurra-kurlu can provide some stability and guidance in this challenging time. For example, he has identified that most Warlpiri feel trapped between two cultures. Young people particularly feel that engagement with the mainstream organisations that run Lajamanu requires too great a departure from their Warlpiri life, while on the other hand the culture of their elders seems increasingly irrelevant. The result is that many people are in a kind of social no-man’s land where the values of neither culture are learned. Grappling with this choice causes confusion, apathy, and violence. In some cases youth now know so little of their own culture that they do not even have the luxury of choosing which culture they want to follow. Wanta also states that older yapa now have little confidence in their own ideas and therefore are afraid to speak (see also Folds 2001). \n&gt; \n&gt; Wanta’s goal with ngurra-kurlu is to address this fundamental issue. The message is deceptively simple: Warlpiri law and culture once provided people with stability, self esteem and direction. It can still do this if it is reinterpreted in the context of community living. Said another way, Wanta is promoting the message that it is ‘OK to be Warlpiri’. He states that by maintaining a strong identity Warlpiri can have good lives and opportunities to engage with the rest of the world, without being smothered by it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Wanta’s philosophy is similar to that of other Aboriginal leaders, such as Arrernte elder Rosalie Kunoth-Monks, who said: \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; In times where land and culture appear to have forsaken us, what is it that we need to establish more than anything? I put it to you that if we are to accept change then it must not come at the expense of our identity. (Kunoth-Monks 2007:3) \n&gt; \n&gt; A similar sentiment was expressed by one of Australia’s foremost anthropologists, WEH Stanner in 1968 (reflecting on the previous 30 years). Stanner suggests that Australians have failed to grasp that: \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; … on the evidence the aborigines [sic] have always been looking for two things. A decent union of their lives with ours, but on terms that let them preserve their own identity, not their inclusion willy nilly in our scheme of things and a fake identity, but development within a new way of life that has the imprint of their ideas. (Stanner 1968:28)\n&gt;\n&gt; (Pawu-kurlpurlurnu &amp; Holmes, 2008, p. 9)\n\n\nThanks for reading if you took the time to get through all that. I’d love to hear peoples thoughts:\n\n\n* Do you agree that the SDGs and sustainability discourse more broadly can / do perpetuate colonial ideas?\n* If so, what do you see as the way forward here? New goals? New phrasing? Practicing what we have mindfully, like some argue? \n* If so, maybe you can see this same thing represented elsewhere, in another area or issue?\n* If not, feel free to share your thoughts on why you disagree.

jfmrpe,"Take action against Big Oil in these 3 ways! Hey everyone - hoping the sustainability experts among you can weigh in, but I've put together 3 ways that we can continue our fight against oil companies and/or push them to adopt sustainable practices by putting our $$$ into greener competitors. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are all easy to do and I've done them quite quickly although the last one is a work in progress. \n\n \n\n1. **Divest from Big Oil.** Do you have oil and gas stocks in your portfolio? Can you switch them out for renewable energy stocks and ETFs? Check out these [recommendations](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/renewable-energy-stocks-to-consider) and let me know what you think.  \n‍\n2. **Switch your bank.** A majority of investment banks including Chase [invest heavily in fossil fuels.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrvetter/2020/03/18/jpmorgan-chase-tops-dirty-list-of-35-fossil-fuel-funding-banks/#615a76515dfe) I recently used [Mighty Deposits](https://mightydeposits.com/) to find a bank that works for me — instead of investing in dirty energy, my money is going towards building community and boosting small businesses. **This took me literally 10 minutes -** I didn't switch all my $ but I moved a significant amount of savings into NCB coop since they have a high-yield savings account.   \n‍\n3. **Use less plastic.** You're probably slammed this week with emails/calls/texts from political campaigns. You already know the importance of voting, so I'll keep this last action simple. As we learned in [Plastics 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggh0Ptk3VGE), crude oil and natural gas are the main ingredients in plastic. Keep up your fight against Big Oil by reducing single-use plastic — our habits have the power to add up and cascade to the source.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are some other ideas or unintended consequences to consider? For example, I talked to an expert about how divesting from American oil companies might lead to shadier international offshoring -- I don't know enough about that so I can't comment. I'd love to hear your thoughts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, these tips are adapted from my 3-min weekly action plans on climate change which you can [check out here.](https://www.soapboxproject.org/archive/big-oil-wants-climate-change#act) I have some facts and a short video on that link as well to provide more context on Big Oil and 50 years of climate deception."

Hi everyone, I’m in a bit of a “sustainability” pickle and wanted to hear perspectives and opinions from people other than my family and friends. I’m having issues with finding the right balance between enjoying my life and being sustainable, I essentially don’t know how far to take it. So here’s a bit of background:\nI’m a 20 year-old university student and I will be graduating next summer. Ever since I was 15ish I’ve been dreaming of living in van to travel Europe while pursuing my passion of the outdoors (skiing, mountain biking, rock climbing, hiking) and have been saving up money to do so since then. With me graduating next summer, the job market being what it is due to COVID and not having any jobs or obligations lined up for the next year or more, I’ve essentially come to the conclusion that it’s now (or rather next summer) or never. \nHowever I’m having a hard time making an actual decision and pulling the trigger on a van due to the environmental crisis we’re in. I’m passionate about sustainability (am planning on working in the renewable energy sector) and have been trying to live as sustainable as I possibly can. I’ve been buying clothes second hand, buying refurbished electronic devices instead of getting them new, gone vegan (bit of both for environmental and ethical tbf) and am currently starting my zero waste journey. I see buying a van as me just going directly against what I stand for and making all the actions that I listed completely useless because I’ll just be part of the problem like everyone else as I’ll be burning fossil fuels.  I know living in a van is what I want to do and that if I don’t do it I’ll regret it till the day I die but I just can’t figure out whether my stance on sustainability should stand in the way of one of my main dreams/goals in life.\nI’m sure many of us probably had or are having similar experiences so I’d love to hear your thoughts on this matter and if you have any tips I’m all ears, thanks a lot and hopefully see you in the comments :)"

jhr1b0,"Organic ≠ better The assumption is often made that organic food is better for the environment. That is not true. It many cases it is, but in many it is not. As with most things in life, it is more complex than that and there are nuances to consider.\n\nMy name is Andrew (@wild\_biologist) I am a researcher in Agricultural Sustainability and in this post I go into some detail about the differneces between *organic* and *conventional* agriculture and the types of things we may want to consider when comparing them. I am not saying, nor believe, that either are inherrently better. I support and buy from a variety of farms including both organic and conventional. This may be slightly UK centric, but it does apply more widely.\n\n**TL;DR** at the bottom\n\n**Location** \- The suitability of organic production methods will vary greatly based on localised environmental factors such as soil type. Picking the right production methods for your environment is more important than if you chose to be organic or not. \n\nThe country you are in will also make a huge differnece. The requirements for organic certification vary worldwide, the laws (and their enforcement) regarding fertiliser and pesticide inputs in conventional systems will also vary. Furthermore, the typical producton system has to be considered. Taking beef as an example, in the UK the overwhelming majority is outdoor grass fed. Where as in the US a far larger proportion of beef is produced using imported grain. The difference between these two systems may be more signficiant than any difference between organic and conventional systems.\n\nTo give one annecdotal example: I worked on a project looking at wheat production and fertiliser use in China. The soil was so devoid of nutrients it acted almost exclusively as an anchor for the plants. Fertliser had to be used for the plants to grow, but the gratuitous amounts used and the soils inability to hold the nutrients was leading to huge run-off and damage to environmental and human health. This would simply not need to or be allowed to happen in many other countries.\n\n**Fertilisers** \- Fertiliser run-off is a major envrionmental risk. The careful application of fertiliser is absolutely crucial to any system, organic or conventional. Timing it with the weather, knowing how much to apply and where. \n\n*Inorganic* fertilisers have an inherrent production and transportation footprint. But we must realise that they do serve a purpose to increase yields, which must be balanced against that cost. A notable benefit is that inorganic fertilisers are a known entity. With modern precision farming, it is now more feasible than ever to know and apply accurate amounts of fertiliser. This is far more difficult with organic fertilisers as the nutrient contents are more variable and unknown. These fertilisers also have notable emissions once deposited. \n\nOne issue we have is that most countries have discrete livestock regions and arrable regions. Therefore, the organic fertlisers (manures) are not near the crops they could provie nutrients for. But, this issue is caused by the reasonably fair logic that some land areas are unsuitable for crops.\n\nFertilisers cost money and nutrient run off is money being washed away. No farmer wants to apply a single gram more fertiliser than thay absolutely need to and we are getting better and better at ensuring that - but still work to be done.\n\n**Pesticides** \- This isn't a circle to be squared. Pesticides struggle to be specific enough and do impact non-target specis significantly. However, similar to inorganic fertilisers, they do serve a purpose to increase yields. These two factors must be considerd in the context of...\n\n**Land use efficiency** \- This is where the increased yields through inorganic fertilisers and pestiides are important. Organic farming typically has significantly lower yields than conventional. Consequently, a greater land area is used to produce the same amount of food. For many crops a -20% yield would be a conservative estimate. Taking that example, we have to ask what that extra land could be used for. For example... 8km2 of conventional barley + 2km2 of woodland/flower meadow might be better, on the whole, than 10km2 of organic barley. But perhaps that spare 2km2 wouldn't be used like that. The impact of increasing agricultural land use has to be weighted against the impact of fertilisers and pesticides. The best option will likely vary case by case.\n\nThis is especially problematic for crops grown in rainforest regions. The production of organic cacao and coffee has led to excess deforestation of high-value rainforest. Speaking to arguably the world expert on sustainably cacoa production, I was told, in no uncertain terms, to avoid organic chocolate.\n\nA recent article in *Nature* suggests that if the entirity of the UK switched to organic farming, that net greenhouse gas emission would increase as a consequence, due to the increase in land required: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12622-7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12622-7)\n\nI cannot stress enough the importance of land use efficiency. It is very difficult to quantify and often ignored when considering the environmental impact and/or GHG impact of organic foods. As our population continues to expand, this will become more and more crucial.\n\n**Livestock** \- I wanted to briefly mention that most organic certifications have good criteria for livestock, for example outdoor grazing requirements. I don't buy meat, but I do by organic milk, though in part because it's the easiest for me to acquire locally + zero waste.\n\nA potential issue with organic livestock is slower growth rates, which lead to more lifetime GHG emissions.\n\n**Organic box ticking -** Becomming certified organic requires ticking various boxes. To some extent this can be arbitary. I've met farmers who meet the criteria but don't certify. I've met farmers who exceed all other criteria, but fell foul of one of them. An organic dairy farmer I met had to bring his cattle in early one year due to weather conditions, but lost his organic certification as a result, he now no longer bothers. What I'm saying is that a huge number of conventional farms may be quite close to organic, exceeding the requirements in many ways, but not be certified.\n\nMany conventional farmers employ much of the same tips and tricks that organic farmers do; increased legumes for N sequestration, diversifying pastures, providing habitat for wildlife (which can control pests) etc. Such techniques are not exclusive to organic.\n\n**Genetic modification** \- I have no idea how this sub views genetic modfiication. As an environmental scientist whose #No.1 mission and passion is to mitigate environmental damage and protect the planet, I am in favour of the expansion of genetically modified crops into the mass consumer market. As far as I know, no organic certification in the world allows for the inclusion of genetically modified crops, which I feel is a mistake. They hold the potential to reduce fertiliser and pesticide use, whilst maintaining or increasing yields and therefore land use efficiency. The technology can be incredibly safe, arguably more so than selective breeding, especially if intraspecific. \n\n**Sampling bias** \- Farmers who choose to go organic have made a consciencsious decission. The nature of this means that they are typically farmers who are innovative, are especially consciencious of nature, and pay attention to detail and work hard. One I know has introduced wild beavers to his farm! Whilst these traits are true of a huge number of conventional farmers, I would hesitate to say that it is especially true of organic farmers. I know when I visit an organic farmer, I will be meeting someone who is excited about farming and what they do. Consequently, when looking at organic farms, you are also looking at exceedingly good farmers. It is often the fact that they are good farmers that makes their systems good, not necessarily because it is organic.\n\n**Summary** \- Organic is not a synonym for sustainability, though it is an important part of it. More important is how well a farm is managed - their restraint and control of fertilisers and pesticides, and their utilisation of natrual capital. An organic farm can do huge enviornmental damage, though the worst case scenario is not as bad as a convential farms maximum potential damage. On the other hand, a perfeclty managed conventional farm is likely to produce more food, for less environmental cost, than a perfectly managed organic farm. As with most things, it's a balance of risk and rewards and how much we can trust those in charge of managing that risk.\n\nThat's it for now. Undoubtedly there will be things missed, but I think I covered the main bases, though I may add some info on later as it comes to me.\n\n**TL;DR** \- buy local, buy seasonal, buy zero waste, buy from farms you know are good. There a positives and negatives of organic and conventional production - with no clear winner"

jhvete,"Commercially Compostable Diapers So I am expecting my first child and though my husband and I intending on cloth diapering most of the time we know that disposable diapers will be necessary occasionally. Through research I have learned that the ""compostable"" diapers available to us are actually commercially compostable, meaning that they need to be composted in a commercial facility. This is a problem because there are no commercial composting facilities anywhere near where we live. After some digging I have found that the waste from our municipality goes to an energy to waste plant that is apparently pretty eco friendly. From what I understand the waste is incinerated to produce electricity and then whatever is left goes to the landfill.\n\nThe thing is I don't really understand a lot about these processes. What I want to know is it is still better for these compostable diapers to go to an energy to waste plant than a regular diaper? I can only imagine that what remains after one of these diapers is incinerated has to be better that what's left after burning traditional disposable diapers. Please help!"

jhyqp9,"Anyone had this experience with Girlfriend Collective? I've been tempt to make a post for a while, but I've been waiting to try and resolve the issue, and they've gone dark on me, so I'm just gonna ask here.\n\nIn a search to find some sustainable clothing, I found Girlfriend collective, who is Seattle based (I have confirmed they are registered in Washington State). I figured sure, and ordered some leggings from them. \n\nWhen my package shipped, I found out through their shipping partner that my package was being shipped from Hong Kong. I found this particularly weird, because their website's about me [contains the following statement](https://prnt.sc/v6kpa8), which specifically calls out Chinese certifications and accountability standards.\n\nTheir website did specify that they do work specifically in Taiwan and Vietnam, so a package from Taiwan would have been nothing surprising, but the connection to Hong Kong/China, despite their statement, was really shocking to me.\n\nI tried to contact them for transparency, and I got this non-answer:\n\n&gt;Our orders are packed and fulfilled from our warehouse overseas which is why your order has to process at customs, which is also why most orders take about 7-10 business days to arrive once the order processes. You can view more information on our shipping timelines and processes here:[https://girlfriend.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043304193-When-will-my-order-arrive-](https://girlfriend.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043304193-When-will-my-order-arrive-)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To confirm, we do source our textiles made from recycled materials from our facility in Taiwan which is then cut-and-sewn in our SA8000 certified factory in Hanoi, Vietnam. For more information, you can check our the following pages and resources:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, it said absolutely nothing about how or why my leggings are in Hong Kong. I tried to press more, but it seems like they've ghosted me.\n\nHas anyone else had this experience, or has an answer for what happened here? It honestly just dodges me out, because I feel kind of lied to. I think it was the specific ""call out"" of China that makes me think there is some dishonesty here, but I just wanted to ask if anyone knows about this and could provide some insight. Thanks!"

That's why we cannot do infrastructural changes. Solar panels is something that we really want to add to building but it's really too expensive because of my country's money is 8times worthless than USD. \n\nMy action plan is \n1)water will be filtered them bottled in glass bottles, we don't purchase bottled water whether is in plastic or glass bottles \n2)utilize kitchen scraps for something else for like stock or something else, if not compost them or feed it to goats or chickens \n3)instead of bleach use hydrogen peroxide solutions\n4)vinegar and baking soda will still be with us in this journey too\n5) **** BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAN I USE INSTEAD OF CHLORINE BASED PROFESSIONAL DISHWASHER DETERGENT ******* there is no toxic chemical free eco friendly detergent in my country, or maybe in any other countries. \n6)I will make liquid soap for general cleaning purpose from leftover frying oil.\n7)I try to persuade my partners (because we will be in the kitchen we are both chefs) to switch to cloth towels instead of paper ones. \n8)we will use cloth napkins instead of paper ones\n9)I will make some basic bathroom products from natural resources (like clay, oil,sugar scrub, facial toners from the pine needles around, body butters, body soaps). And they will be in glass containers. \n10) buy  toothpaste tablets in bulk and put some in bathrooms.\n11)*******SHOULD WE PUT BAMBOO TOOTHBRUSH TO BATHROOMS BY DEFAULT? or is it not a good idea. If they use it and don't take it with them to use it for later uses, isnt that be a lot of waste? But if we don't put it, what would a customer think? \n12) maybe we purchase little tester-sized shampoo bars  in bulk, I'm not really sure about that because if they don't like it or leave it, we can't repurpose or reuse it and it becomes waste. But if we buy liquid shampoo in bulk and put it in pump bottles, anyone can use it as much as they need and we can always fill it? But there would be empty soap containers, and they may not be recycled.\n13)Instead of single use cotton make up pads, we may be add reusable cotton cloth pads? I know they will be sanitized daily  but how do our guests would feel like? Actually why wouldn't they, hotel guests share the same towels, same sheets same pillow cases. \n14)wheat straw instead of plastic ones. Not reusable but edible for animals, or compostable.\n15)we try to make almost every ingredient and not buy it from stores. But even we do it will be really local and be bought in bulk and in reusable bags \n16)brown paper lined trash bins in the rooms and bathrooms?? \n17)no coffee machines in rooms, but if we decide that people want to make coffee in their rooms, it will be in reusable cups to make it or with French press.\n18) beeswax wraps or cloth covers for cups and glasses in the rooms\n. \n. \nThese are some ways that I can think of.

There’s power in what we purchase.  \n\nThought I’d share with you what I spent my pandemic building with a small team.\n\nToday we’re launching GoodHuman, a place to discover all things sustainable and ethical, in one immersive mobile app. Think Amazon meets Pinterest, for good. Bonus: powered by community. \n\nHumans are cutting down billions of trees a year, filling the oceans with plastic, and the fashion industry alone emits more carbon than international flights &amp; maritime shipping combined. \n\nThere’s a growing scientific consensus, we have a short window to radically reduce our emissions and take urgent, transformative action to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. \n\nThere is no single magic solution. Requires parallel efforts. Think: renewable energy, carbon capture, protecting ecosystems, choosing things that last longer, supporting companies that align with our values and reassessing our consumption. \n\nFortunately, we’ve seen a surge of “ethical native” d2c brands with a focus on sustainability &amp; ethics at the roots. It’s not a marketing add-on, it’s part of their core mission. So… where can you find them? (hint: there’s an app for that) \n\nGoodHuman. We have the largest curated collection of sustainable products from ethical brands and a community of people turning intention into action. And we’re just getting started — we just launched in the Apple App Store.  \n[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodhuman/id1508396837](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodhuman/id1508396837?fbclid=IwAR35BSV8y_5XF48AwhMrl2z1mTr9G4YDtZw1PhEXWpBRTSJr5ySRyqyapY0)\n\nBut what does “good” look like? Some of us care about clean ingredients, others about packaging, social equality, ocean health, animals, etc. With GoodHuman you choose your own journey, personalized to your interests. \n\nWant to know which ethical native brands are also contributing to reforestation?  \n…or are women-owned or BIPOC-founded?  \n…or actively focus on using renewable energy?  \n…or have active recycling/reuse programs?\n\nWe’ve got it all in the GoodHuman app. \n\nBy curating content, brands and products through a sustainable, ethical, and environmentally focused lens, we do the heavy lifting for you. Want to learn more about our process? Check out Our Code: \n\nWe are also community driven, with members ranging from sustainability veterans to curious newcomers. Users can already submit their favorite articles and videos, and we’re building tools for any user to challenge or submit brands.\n\nSystemic change is going to take all of us. Mass social movements are made up of millions of individuals. It is not either-or when it comes to collective v. individual action — they’re two sides of the same coin.\n\nThe GoodHuman app marks a new beginning. Collectively working toward good is more powerful than only a few aiming for perfection. It’s not called perfect human for a reason.\n\nAlso GoodHuman is live on Product Hunt today, you are invited to drop in with feedback and questions.  \n[https://www.producthunt.com/posts/goodhuman](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/goodhuman?fbclid=IwAR0VN4Nnle3RFvGkXVlDglXJT7Vq-W1l--lF_TXHNApWuPEtDH-8Og-roLU)\n\n*Processing video db8tpe7hsuv51...*\n\nSo now you know what we do.

I go the extra mile and have encompassed everything in my life around the concept; my parenting, my education, my career, my eating, my hobbies, etc. It’s my lifestyle and everyday I am looking for new ways to better it. I have no issue sacrificing, as my father taught me well early in life on the importance of wellness over the cheap comforts of our modern life. I am consumed with the bigger picture, and I am proud of it.\nMy passion attracts moral people, but those moral people always reach an eye rolling point it seems with my habits and aspirations. I daydream of having a herb garden, vegetables I can cook fresh with for dinner, eggs from the chicken coop, solar panels on my roof, no plastic to be seen. Everyone says I need to compromise with normalcy, but I say that the time it’s taking me to make my dream a reality is plenty enough compromise. How can one compromise their dreams, their passions. To me, this has become my purpose of living. It gives me a reason for everything I do from sun up to sun down, as without it the optimism it brings I become straight pessimistic. Cynical if you will. I have found the core piece to my identity, and this is in fact number one. \n\nThough I share it with no one in my life, besides my kids- which does count and bring me happiness that no other relation could. I have no friends, no family who I can revel in this passion with regardless. My SO has nothing but tension and anxiety when I bring it up, telling me I’m trying to change their way of life... my words are not enough. They don’t want to watch the educational information that is out there out of fear, I can only assumed.. \nI guess I just want someone to tell me that they too feel this way, so I can remind myself the solitude it brings is temporary, or at least worth it."

For example, if you wanted to rate a company High, Med, Low but only using sustainability related KPIs to drive the rating - what would those KPIs be? \n\n2) Is the data publicly available?

jn2w4c,"Interesting discussion. I'm currently arguing with someone on AITA over this, but it was interesting. Tell me what you guys think:\n\nThe scenario is that there was a flight that went from Budapest to Budapest. It was 47 minutes long, and was basically a tour around the city. This flight took place once on three different days. \n\nThe OP of this post received tickets for this flight as a gift from family, was essentially arguing that it was a waste of time and resources, but stated that their parents should have instead booked him tickets to Iceland, where he wanted to go. For reference, there are (via google flights) about 23 ""flights"" a day (one way) that you can choose, and each has at least two layovers. Total airtime alone minimum is 5 hours. I believe this was separated into one 3 hour and one 2 hour.\n\nThe commenter was arguing the following:\n\n* Because you don't go anywhere, the flight is worthless, and therefore wasteful\n* With Iceland, even if it would technically need more supply, you'd still have a more ""meaningful"" experience, so it would technically offset the issue.\n* People taking these flights typically live in the city already, so its a waste.\n\nThis was my argument:\n\n* For the one way alone, its going to use up more resources with the additional landing/takeoff, plus more in-air time means more fuel burnt.\n* The activity is not ""meaningless"", as this is something that many people would enjoy, some more than Iceland. Therefore, the trips are equally valid in my opinion when it comes to ""worth of experience"", even if it is a domestic audience.\n* With quarantines for entry in Iceland, the amount of PPEs, single use plastics, disposables, etc possibly used on or for OP would be significant for the two weeks, especially in comparison to that not needing to happen domestically.\n* I haven't even tried to wrap my brain around the amount of resources spent in addition going around Iceland, but there's that, too.\n\nI don't know, what do you guys think about this? From what I see, it was approached in a ""one or the other"" scenario. People arguing Iceland vs the flight to nowhere, so that's really where I'd want to keep this. Even if the best answer from a pure sustainability standpoint is ""don't go anywhere at all"". \n\nSo which would you pick (Iceland or the flight to nowhere) and why?"

I write weekly content about sustainability with the goal of making it bite-sized for busy people AND showing folks how to take action on issues they care about.\n\nI'm really proud of this interview we just put out, because I've been dragging my feet on fracking for so long. It seemed too complex and I felt that it was boring, but I learned SOOO much from interviewing Alexandria Shrake, co-founder of ENERGYminute.\n\nI wanted to share it with you here and ask for your thoughts. Please note that this doesn't focus on fracking's outsized impact on communities of color and a lot of the other ""harm"" arguments - feel free to add them but also know that I'm covering fracking every Wednesday this month, so this is just the first installment.\n\n**What is fracking?**\n\nFracking, or hydraulic fracturing is the industrial process of pumping water, sand, and additives (typically over 1 mile) in the ground. Contrary to popular YouTubers opinions, fracking itself does not contaminate groundwater by virtue of existing. It is the mismanagement of the [wellbore casing design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmbbtWFu0EU) that is behind methane leaks near well sites. While this subtly may be indistinguishable and unforgivable from a social and environment perspective, it is critical to address the correct issue to make positive change.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Source: https:\/\/context.capp.ca\/articles\/2018\/feature\_hydraulic-fracturing-101 ](https://preview.redd.it/somyyt7rdbx51.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cd58aa9823d603c627e891935aa9062c6a64caa)\n\n \n\n**Why frack?**\n\nFracking extracts jet fuel and natural gas for electricity and heat.\n\nP.S., if you want to offset your last pre-Covid-19 vacation with carbon credits, [Radicle ](https://travel.radiclebalance.com/)has verified credits you can purchase. Fill in your flight history and the cost of your carbon is auto-calculated. It's a small way to make an individual difference.\n\n‍\n\n**Why is fracking so contentious?**\n\nSound bytes do not tell the full story. “[Ban fracking](https://www.washingtonpost.com/)” is a clear message but does not capture the complications behind the oil and gas industrial complex and the global reliance on fossil fuels.\n\n‍\n\n**What are the pros of fracking?** \n\n* **PRO** \- Fracking actually *reduces* emissions by offsetting coal.  \nFracking has made natural gas more affordable than coal which results in an emissions reduction. Fracking is performed typically to produce natural gas and jet fuel (condensate). Natural gas plants which produce electricity offset coal and create about HALF of the CO2 per unit of energy.  \n‍\n* **PRO** \- Fracking gives the United States energy security and independence.  \nFracking enables an American-grown product instead of importing from foreign sources. Without local sources of energy America &amp; Canada were at the whim of Middle Eastern powers. Without energy security our nations become price takers; manufacturing, heavy industry, and transportation are all reliant on oil and natural gas.  \n‍\n* **PRO** \- Natural gas, a by-product from fracking, has made energy incredibly cheap for Canadians and Americans.  \nThe natural gas we burn to heat our homes and produce electricity is a less desirable by-product from fracking. (What oil and gas companies really want outof the ground is jet fuel.) The natural gas by-product has flooded the North American market, making energy inexpensive.  \n*Spoiler alert: inexpensive energy is not necessarily a good thing.*\n\n‍\n\n**If it's giving us cheap gas and reducing emissions, what are the cons?**\n\n* **CON** \- The process of fracking can leak methane into the atmosphere (that's bad news re: climate change)  \nMethane leaks are an unintended consequence through poor wellbore casing designs. This means methane leaks into the atmosphere due to lack of upholding regulations and monitoring.  \n‍\n* **CON** \- CO2 gets vented into the atmosphere  \nWith no regulations or caps on venting, a well can vent excess formation CO2 into the atmosphere. In Canada, [methane is considered toxic](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/canadian-environmental-protection-act-registry/proposed-methane-regulations-additional-information.html) and there are caps on how much CO2 and methane a well can vent a year to manage these greenhouse gases.  \nMeanwhile in America... [ENERGYminute](https://energyminute.ca/newsletter/22f4bd322a/?u=6b68f8944fe36064a20ace7ce&amp;id=22f4bd322a) wrote a piece on the Environmental Protection Agency regulation rollbacks in August this year which largely deregulated American methane venting and flaring. That's not a good sign for the Earth.  \n‍\n* **CON** \- Mismanagement of water waste disposal and seismic activity  \nWhen waste water is disposed in certain geologic formations, there is evidence of an increase in seismic activity. Also, surface water that is not disposed of properly can contaminate ground water aquifers.  \n‍\n* **CON** \- Natural gas, a by-product from fracking, has made energy incredibly cheap for Canadians and Americans.  \nYou might recognize this one from the ""pro"" section; whoops. It's a con, too, because a flooded market means that people pay little for their consumption. A greater supply of cheap energy means people consume more.\n\n‍\n\n**Banning fracking is more complicated for the environment than it sounds.**\n\nFracking (which, as mentioned above, produces cheap natural gas) **and** the reduction in cost of wind are responsible for the [greatest emissions reduction](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/07012020/infographic-united-states-emissions-2019-climate-change-greenhouse-gas-coal-transportation#:~:text=Transportation%20is%20now%20the%20largest,2019%2C%20declining%20by%200.3%20percent.&amp;text=Emissions%20from%20industry%20rose%20slightly,from%20buildings%20were%20up%2C%20too.) in human history!\n\n‍\n\n‍**Why?** Both wind and natural gas create electricity which offsets coal-fired plants. The tricky part is that you need a consistent energy source for grid reliability, and wind and solar are intermittent. As the grid surges and balances with changing demand, there does need to be a reliable energy source. The resource intensiveness behind high-quality battery storage makes natural gas the strongest contender behind large-scale grid reliability. There are no simple solutions to the industrial oil and gas complex, but we must first understand the problem if we ever want to solve it.\n\n‍\n\n**What would a fracking ban in America look like?**\n\nPrices of energy would initially skyrocket, but level out quickly once foreign oil and natural gas from Canada, the Middle East, and Russia were imported into the country. On average, each American uses [2 1/5 milk jugs of oil a day](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=33&amp;t=6#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20the%20United%20States,billion%20barrels%20of%20petroleum%20products.). While other lower emitting technologies could catch-up over time, it would be incredibly challenging and expensive to replace the [300 billion gallons of oil](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=33&amp;t=6#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20the%20United%20States,billion%20barrels%20of%20petroleum%20products.) a year that America consumes. With the exception of countries that naturally have abundant reliable renewables like Iceland and Costa Rica, all countries are reliant on fossil fuels to some extent because of how much work energy does for us instead of human labor.\n\n‍\n\n**So, should we ban fracking?**\n\nIn short, no. Not right now. There will be a day when fossil fuels are no longer a cornerstone in the industrial **energy** complex, but not until there is sufficient infrastructure. What matters today is regulations on wastewater, flaring, and venting to protect our environment to the best of our ability while we still consume fossil fuels.\n\n‍\n\n**ZOOM OUT: More importantly, does fracking even matter?**\n\nIn short, also no. Especially not at the level of discussion we're having now.\n\nIf fracking were banned, Americans would use energy imported from foreign sources which would completely defeat the purpose of the ban. In Canada there is a strong tie between an [emerging geothermal](https://www.jwnenergy.com/article/2020/5/27/eavor-named-energy-excellence-champion-its-go-anyw/), [lithium](https://www.e3metalscorp.com/), and  [hydrogen ](https://proton.energy/)economy.

I put them in a little mesh bag and throw them in the wash about once a week, and it seems to work great for taking off makeup and for toner.\n\nI've never seen anyone else do this and I thought there must be a reason why it's not more widely used, so I thought I'd come to ask the experts!

jr5v2t,"An Essay on Soil Culture, Contrsuctal Law, Civilized Agriculture, and Ecological Economy. \nHello All, I’m happy to find a community that is talking about the most important thing there is and ever will be, this Earth.\n\n\nI wanted to make this a discusión, and there is so much more information, this is just the bare bones of what I have discovered during my time as a farmer and student.\n\n\n\nCivilized Agriculture destroys the organic cultures of the Earth \n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecognizing the soil as a living ecosystem is key to understanding how life on Earth is designed to exist. The act of tilling to raise monocultures of plants has created an influx of human population at the cost of the natural systems that supported it, through degradation of the soils health and erosion of the earth.\n\nWithout soil, humanity cannot survive. Soil aggregate matter is required to sustain all organic life, the system that robs the earth of this energy and burns it, is known as Civilization.  \n\n\n\nConstructal Law\n\nConstrual law is a theory that states the phenomena of designs in nature is caused by a flow of energy creating these forms. Any sustainable life flows within these systems, instead of consuming and destroying them.\n\nThe way soil organic communities sequester carbons is part of an organic flow system. Organisms living in the soil are necessary for the recycling of dead organic matter. This flow system is interrupted by tilling the earth. Organic flow systems create life, the bodies that best adapt to these systems thrive.\n\nManipulation of the environment must be balanced with the resources available to it. If the body takes more than the system is organically capable of giving, that system will be in a deficit, causing a collapse and eventually cessation of flow.\n\nThe waste of carbon matter has led to the increase of carbon gases. Methods like no till, cover crops, and regenerative farming are just a few ways that these carbons can be sequestered in their organic flow systems.  \n\n\n\n\nEnergy conservation/Carbon Sequestration\n\nSoil tilling is a system designed to turn out a specify kind of crop without regard to energy taken form the earth. Tilling attempts to control weeds by disturbing and breaking up the earth.\n\nSoil organic carbons are lost due to a lack of microbial communities that use the carbon residue for energy, and carbon gases release into the atmosphere because of the destruction of the soil cultures.  Conservation Agricultural (CA) practices such as no till, crop rotation and residue control were used in a study in Northwest India. (Jat et al., 2019).\n\nThe study finds that CA improve soil health and organic carbon build up. In the comparison to the tilled methods, and no till methods, no till had the highest amount of soil aggregate carbon, meaning the amount of organic energy within no till systems was higher than that of till systems, so the soil had more nutrients and energy to grow crops and maintain soil composition.\n\nIn Multiple studies conducted by the Natural Resources Conservation Service Soils, a subsidiary of the USDA, found that soil health management practices and implementation have positive effects on soil water holding capacity and soil water retention. (NRCS, 2016)  \n\n\n\nTill culture\n\nThe parallel of tilling to disrupt the earth and removing weeds, and a civilized society uprooting cultures of people, are made clear in the article, The Science of 'Civilized' Agriculture: The Mixed Farming Discourse in Zimbabwe.\n\nCivilized Agriculture is the imposition of unsustainable agriculture practices. The pretext for destroying organic communities is met with a roundabout justification of “progress”.\n\nThe progression of technological society has been at a cost of the organic societies of the Earth. This process has been used by different colonial empires and during this time the idea of scientific progression and religious salvation was used in unison with conventional farming practices.\n\nBy destroying the organic cultures of the soil, the cultures of the people are subsequently destroyed as well. The people who were supported by the natural world must take up an unnatural way of life.\n\nDevelopment of disease of the physical and mental types, caused by the biological and psychological culture shock of the toxic byproducts of discriminatory ideology, industrial pollution, and civilized consumption.\n\nBefore people had more time to spend with their families and lead a “simple life”, they must now struggle to live on the land that was once theirs, all for the sake of “civilization”.  \n\n\n\nEducation and Economics\n\nEcological literacy starts with the people closest to the earth. Farmers, country, mountain, and costal societies who value their natural world. Because they spend so much time with the earth, they may be more receptive to the ideas and lifestyle changes that would save them money and preserve the environment they value.\n\nThis may be the best win over human society. Money. Discount rates are a way to measures the current worth of something and projecting that worth into the future, making it possible to put a price on soil organic matter.  \n\nNaturally, the myopia of humanity can be cured using a tool to project and measure ecological growth, as economic growth. From an El Paso city plan: *El Paso’s shrubland can also be viewed as a natural capital asset that provides a flow of benefits over time, like a building or a bridge. *\n\n*When measured like an asset with a lifespan of 100 years and a three percent discount rate, El Paso’s natural capital has an asset value between $106 million and $209 million. With sufficient stewardship to maintain the health and function of El Paso’s natural capital, this economic contribution will continue in perpetuity. These are highly conservative estimates that will grow as data gaps are filled and economic methods are developed.* (El Paso, TX, Livable City Sustainability Plan, n.d.)  \n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe expansion of civilization has caused the destruction of soil cultures, and the soil organic flow systems that sustains all life on earth, including human life. The science of constructal law and soil carbon sequestration is evidence of the innate ability of nature to conserve energy and resources.\n\nThe history of civilized agriculture is a result of a destructive ideology that does not understand this natural world. Without the Earths soils, biological life on it will cease to exist organically.\n\nThe inorganic systems implemented by civilization has robbed the Earth of its life making soils, and It is possible to beat this inorganic system of capital production at its own game through economic-ecological education.  \n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nWolmer, W., &amp; Scoones, I.

I have a BS in Biology and have been out of school for several years working in cannabis.

It could be something along the lines of sustainability, design psychology, climate change- ANYTHING but the construction of thoughtless glass/ concrete jungles! \n\nI’ve researched a bit too much about the available choices and have reached a mental block that is making me increasingly disillusioned with the field. Any advice with regard to suitable Graduate Programs would be highly appreciated.\n\nThanks!"

Hello all. \n\nSo due to pandemic isolation, as well as winter encroaching, I have been trying to find ways to accomplish some activism from home. I sent one of those Sierra Club pre-formatted emails regarding the Clean Economy Act to my representative here in Wyoming (who happens to be Liz Cheney), mostly as a low-effort way to do something. I received a canned response back (I'm well aware this does not come from my rep herself), which is in line with Cheney's stances on the environment on her website, including reducing regulations, the EPA, and trying to further carbon-capture technology (while increasing coal and oil usage).\n\nI really want to write a counter-response, both as a way to debate these stances, as well as get her/her team's reasonings behind their positions. I hardly hope to change any opinions, more to put them on record for some of these things. \n\nBut here's the thing: is it really worth the time and effort for me to write this counter-response for someone to type ""you can't regulate good behavior"" and think they've won? I don't know, I guess I'm just feeling a little hopeless on what I can do with some of this. What would some of you do?\n\nAs background, I recently moved to Wyoming, have a degree in Environmental Sciences, but am currently not working in the field."

Some big companies owns thousands of nodes that they do not even fullfill. Sometimes when they are completed they just buy or built more date centers that keep producing really high CO2 emissions. \n\nAll of this is avoidable, in the World there are many people that have some storage capacity empty. This nodes are already functioning and therefore consuming, so it is more respectful for the environment to use this space that is already there but it is unused than create new storage space that is going to contribute to damage the environment.\n\nFor me the environment is super important but it is also true that because of my work I need plenty of space to storage my data but I was feeling quite bad using those Cloud that do not respect the World (because if in all the other areas of my live I was trying to take care of our planet why should I resign to do it in the online area?).

[**A Datebox night**](https://dateboxclub.com/collections/subscription-plans) **for your cuffed friends.** You can gift a budget-friendly date and help nudge your friends out of quarantine complacency.

[**A National Parks Pass**](https://store.usgs.gov/pass#:~:text=%2480%20Annual%20pass%20plus%20a,recreation%20sites%20across%20the%20country.)**.** I went on a COVID-safe road trip earlier this year and the parks pass was so clutch (driving pun, haha). It's in your benefit to gift this to someone in your quarantine bubble, because it's per car admission (not per person). So give it to your car-owning roommate and get free admission to U.S. National Parks; your purchase helps keep our parks maintained, too.  \nPrice: $85; valid for a year  \n‍  \n‍\n4. **One year of** [**Masterclass.**](https://www.masterclass.com/gift) This is another fantastic high-quality, no-waste gift for the person in your life who loves to learn and takes up new hobbies every month.  \n‍  \nPrice: $180 for the year  \n‍  \n‍\n5. **Classes at the** [**Circus Center**](http://circuscenter.org/online)**.** I've been taking classes at the Circus Center in San Francisco for over two years and I've started doing them virtually.

Reporter Emily Atkin helps us direct our activism where it matters - often big oil and gas companies.  \nPrice: I think it's $7/month  \n‍  \n‍\n7. **A subscription to local news.** Climate action and civic action in general happens powerfully on a local level where people's voices really matter. However, it can be incredibly hard to figure that out without a reliable local news source.

jt7rlh,"How much is too much I was thinking about benchmarks to help consumers gauge for themselves if they are spending too much.

But, if Americans, consumed less then there wouldn’t be such an impetus to extract so many resources in the rest of the world. \nIs it true that if I consume more than my fair share, that means someone else in the world is consuming less than their fair share?\nSo, what if we took the average global income (which is about $18,000/year) as a fair benchmark and say that each American only has the right to $18,000 worth of resources per year, and if they are spending more than that (unless they make efforts to purchase fair trade or sustainable products) they are consuming more than they have a right too. \n\nJust wondering if this line of reasoning makes any sense. \n\nSetting a simple monetary spending benchmark is much easier to keep track of than other metrics, I’m thinking."

I suspect everybody on this subreddit has their own opinions about these questions and it might be interesting to share. Here is my best guess (heavily influenced by William Leach's [Land of Desire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Desire))\n\n* When: \~1890\n* Where: North East US and the Chicago area in particular\n* Who:  The inventors of the department stores and along with them the ""consumer"" class\n* Why: Finding outlets for industrial overproduction so as to capitalize more of the labor surplus\n\nUnderstanding the causes of that initial cultural ""mutation"" is quite important to help find ways to immunize against its virality. The most daunting sustainability challenge today seems to me is that vast numbers of humanity aspire to the same standard of ""good life"" invented back then, even if it manifestly does not lead to balanced and happy individuals (just look at the current state of the ""early adopter"" US). \n\nIncidentally the need to build on that consumption model seems to be at least the nominal driving force behind surveillance capitalism (personalized ads, automated personalized production etc.)  although I don't think that this ever really worked as intended and is quickly morphing into something much darker.\n\nNB: I say ""accelerated"" unsustainability because in my view we are solidly on that path even without the consumerist explosion of the last century. E.g. biodiversity has been decimated anywhere Homo Sapiens migrated since the last ice age (which is now the entire planet). We always lacked any built-in (universal) awareness of the finiteness of the planet and the fragility of its ecosystems (as we evolved in a far more humble / localized context) and finding ways to change that cultural blind spot seems to be a worthwhile pursuit..."

I thought it was one of the few *tangible* ways for folks to have conversations with their loved ones especially around the holidays. It includes a story about how a Republican congressman's son convinced him to be climate-forward as well as a 6-step ""deep canvassing"" approach to climate conversations.\n\nHere's the link: [https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet/j4hk928](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet/j4hk928)\n\nI'll paste the steps here too if it's helpful -- the following is taken directly from the link above \n\n\---------------\n\nHere are the six steps outlined by Steve Deline with the [New Conversation Initiative](https://www.newconvo.org/) on how to have difficult conversations about climate change.\n\n**Step 1 – Set realistic expectations for yourself!**\n\nYour initial goal should be to lower the temperature around this issue. Even if you just succeed in attempting to talk to them one on one, or expressing a DESIRE to do so, that’s an important step forward! Do NOT set yourself an expectation that you will change how they feel about climate all in one go! \n\n**Step 2 – Find a buddy!**\n\nFind someone you trust and feel comfortable with who’s down to be your support before and after having a challenging conversation with a friend or family member. Talk to them about what your fears are, and name some goals for what you’re doing to make this one go different. \n\n**Step 3 – Find a quiet moment to talk to your family member**\n\nIdeally do it when you can be one on one, NOT surrounded by the whole family at the actual Thanksgiving table! Be direct and say “Hey, I’d love to find a time to talk more about this.” So that they have a chance to opt in.\n\n**Step 4 – Listen!**\n\nWhen the time comes to talk, start by letting them know that you really want to understand how they feel about climate change. Listen, and ask follow up questions “Tell me more? Why do you feel that way?” But importantly DON’T RESPOND. Don’t engage with the parts that you disagree with. Just give them a chance to talk it out and be heard, you want to let them get the crux of their feelings on the subject off their chest. \n\n**Step 5 – Acknowledge that you disagree**\n\nLet them know what you think. For example “Got it. So you’re probably not surprised to hear it but I think climate change is real and human-caused.” But then most importantly, say “BUT I really want to find a way to talk to you about it openly, and better understand what each other thinks, even if we don’t agree.” In other words, name the elephant in the room – that you disagree – and name it without being upset about it!\n\n**Step 6 – Make it personal.**\n\nTurn the conversation away from dueling facts, and towards life and experiences. For example, I might share a story about my friend Laurel, whose sister lost her home to a wildfire in Paradise, CA, and how hearing her story was the first time I felt a knot of fear in my stomach, that my own community could be in danger of the same thing. The key here is to share vulnerably, and then talk about how it made you FEEL. And then (most importantly) invite them to do the same – bring emotion explicitly into the conversation.\n\n\------------------\n\nI write free, weekly action plans on climate change that you can find [here](https://www.soapboxproject.org/changeletter).

Indoor vegetable garden\n\nHi plant friends! \n\nHow do you refresh your soil after growing vegetables Indoors? \n\nI have many different containers, of all different sizes, and a variety of different plants in most containers. I started out with pretty good quality soil with all of the necessary components for good drainage etc. I added nutrients as needed. \nI want to fix my soil for the next round of crops as opposed to purchasing new soil for both environmental and economic reasons. \n\n- Should I dump a few containers into a tote, mix in compost and worm castings, and then refill my containers? It seems this would be similar to crop rotation but instead it’s soil rotation. Additionally, compost and worm castings would add beneficial microbes and nutrients. All of the drainage material are still there so I would only add more if it needs it. \n\nIs this a good plan or is there something else I can do? Perhaps add fertilizer of some sort? \n\n*I really do want to improve my soil instead of buying/making a new mix, but if that’s not advisable can I dump this in my outdoor raised bed? I am not sure if perlite is bad for the garden/nature. I have a new raised bed that will need soil in the spring regardless. It’s currently sheet compost but will need topsoil and compost in the spring before planting. (Southern Maine)"

Its usually the following cases:\n\n* A blog post or other information made by a particular group or company in order to push their product, but the title of the post is changed to something more generalized and unrelated, as if this an article meant to be educational. \n* An individual who claims they've written an article and want us to read it, but then you look and its either ""sponsored by"" or ""cowritten by"" a group or organization. \n* Individuals who post things about how you need to check out this cool resource, but upon further digging you realize its them promoting their own content.\n\nI just think that it would be cool for us all as a community to think more about what kind of information we are putting out there with the intent of having others consume it, and how we can be more transparent with it. Here's a few suggestions:\n\n*  If you're using a company's post, cite why. A little ""I saw this company article and now I wonder about other similar companies"" or ""this is a company page but has several direct links to the exact terms of xx law and that's what I'm really citing"" go a long way.\n* Being transparent and upfront when you write an article that it has a sponsor or cowriter, rather than claiming the work to be yours entirely, without any additional input or influence. \n* Being transparent and upfront that you're promoting your own business, rather than initially telling someone to just ""check this cool thing out"". \n\nJust some food for thought.

k28jrt,"I visited a Christmas Tree Farm to learn how sustainable live trees really were Last week, I arranged a visit to a 60+ year old Christmas Tree Farm to interview the owners and learn about the sustainability of buying a live tree over plastic. I learned a ton and will always be buying a live tree from here on out.  The farm is home to multiple stumps more than 40 years old providing new Christmas trees every 4-7 years.\n\nLink to the full article I wrote about it below, but here are the portions related to sustainability:\n\nIt seems the public still has many misunderstandings about the sustainability and eco-friendliness of Christmas tree farms.\n\nFake trees may be convenient and clean, but they are definitively bad for the environment. Artificial trees are made of non-renewable and non-biodegradable materials such as metals and plastics. Although they are bought with the intention of years of reuse, the average family only uses their fake tree for six to nine years before sending it to the landfill, where it will likely remain for centuries. Most are manufactured in Chinese factories and imported to the U.S., and some may even contain toxins like lead.\n\nAlthough it may seem counterintuitive, purchasing a real tree from a farm is actually the more sustainable option. Because most Christmas trees are grown on a farm, they are a renewable resource. Christmas tree farms occupy around 350,000 acres in the U.S., preserving green spaces, stabilizing the soil, protecting water supplies and providing refuge for wildlife throughout the year. There are, however, further levels of sustainable growing practices even among Christmas tree farmers.\n\nThe thing that makes this tree farm truly unique among Christmas tree farms is the way in which they grow the majority of their trees. Instead of planting a new tree each time one is cut down, they utilize the tree’s natural survival mechanisms to re-grow trees from old stumps. This method of re-growing trees is called “stump cultivation.”\n\nInstead of allowing people to cut a tree from the very base,  “cutters”  will saw the tree slightly higher, leaving about two whirls of branches on the leftover stump. By leaving enough foliage, the cutters ensure that the stump and root system have enough resources to be able to sprout new branches naturally.\n\nWhen people are left to cut trees on their own, they often cut it too short, killing the stump and stopping future growth.\n\n“People in the city often don’t know that you can re-grow a tree,” said Sam.\n\nAfter cutting a tree, they seal the trunk to prevent insects from invading and disease from spreading. “All of these branches will turn up, and then we decide which one will make the best tree.” Once they can see an ideal branch has sprouted up, they will prune it until it takes on the quintessential Christmas tree cone shape.\n\nWhile walking the property, Sam pointed out a few massive tree stumps that have been used to grow Christmas trees for over 40 years. Sam wishes other Christmas tree farms would recognize this amazing ability and begin growing trees this way. Not only does it save the time of re-planting, but it saves resources that are used to grow saplings in nurseries. The small number of trees that they do receive from nurseries, they try to source locally so the trees are acclimated to the Northern California climate.  \n\n\nFull article: [https://www.mklibrary.com/live-christmas-trees/](https://www.mklibrary.com/live-christmas-trees/)"

k3jdpr,"Suggestion: How to use the free market to increase the durability of products. The solution is simple: For consumer products that are not expendable and above a certain value (250 USD or something on that order of magnitude) you require that the retailer or manufacturer be willing to take back the product at any given time, safely dispose of it and then give back a certain fraction of the price (Probably 50% of the sell price), depending on implementation this may be adjusted for inflation. \n\nHow will this solve the problem? Simple: The company knows that the customer (Or those who picked it up at the scrap yard) will most likely try to return it. Thus they will constantly know how much they will eventually have to pay back. They will therefore put money aside and invest it. Over time income from the investment will make the company money, and inflation make the payback less significant. Thus the company will try to postpone the payment as much as possible. The only way to do this is by making products that last and service them to last longer. And since a given product will return to the company there is a good chance that by stockpiling products one could make disassemly lines whenever a certain amount of of produce has been returned. This would allow for reuse of parts and better recycling of scrap.\n\nYour thoughts?"

k5as51,"This browser extension offsets your carbon emissions to make your online shopping more sustainable Hey guys ! \n\nI found out the other week that for online shopping, 49% of U.S. consumers start by looking at Amazon.\n\n**The problem** \n\nThe digital shopping market has opened up doors for economic growth, and has changed the way we browse and buy.\n\nHowever, online shopping has also accelerated environmental issues. While online purchases cater to convenience, they are also responsible for increased levels of greenhouse gases released, especially CO2, per item, per order.\n\nWhile the most sustainable way to shop might be to not shop online at all, there are ways to make the process better for the planet.\n\n**The solution**\n\nWith 2 friends, we built CarbonCroc. CarbonCroc is the first browser extension that offsets the delivery of your online shopping. For free.\n\nWhen installed, CarbonCroc’s algorithm accounts for your online shopping purchases to automatically calculate the amount of greenhouse gases released during the shipment of your order.\n\nCarbonCroc will compensate for the carbon impact of the delivery between the warehouse where your purchased product is stored and your front door. The browser extension is actually designed to overcompensate and overestimate for a calculated amount, as we know the carbon released during shipping depends on many factors.\n\nCarbonCroc receives an affiliate commission directly from the companies you purchase from, simply because you used the CarbonCroc browser extension to shop. These commissions are directly used to purchase carbon offset credits or invested in carbon removal based on your order calculations.\n\nThis means we don’t keep your data because our revenue is coming from the merchant directly!\n\nYou can check out our[ FAQ](https://carboncroc.com/faq) for more details and we would be super happy to receive any feedback\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnline shopping is not yet a fully sustainable practice and should not be considered as such at this point in time. However, with some innovation, action and awareness, it can improve tremendously. All it takes is consumer cooperation and initiatives like CarbonCroc to raise the bar for environmental advocacy and sustainability.\n\nPlain and simple: if you’re ordering off Amazon for Christmas, carbon offset your shipping with CarbonCroc.\n\n[https://carboncroc.com/](https://carboncroc.com/)"

I bought mine years ago when I got my own place, I put it up, and when the season changes I just update the settings. That's it.\n\nObviously if you already have lights use what you have. Or if you don't care about holiday lights then it's definitely better to not buy anything at all. But I know for me I love having these as a permanent decoration that I can change for the season rather than having a bunch of short time use decorations that will just take up space in my home and the environment.\n\nIf anyone else has any other holiday themed sustainability advice please comment it below.\n\nAlso, I will not apologize for the pun in the title."

I can help you with that, but I will at no point accept brand sponsors or push any products for a kick back. \n\nThis is an *introductory rate* to get a feel for how much demand there is for this service and for me to assess how much time a typical audit will take. I'm offering this rate to the first 10 people to PM me.\n\nOnce I receive your message, we can schedule time for a zoom call.

k8uh0h,"Non-toxic liners/coatings Had a hard time figuring out what a good reddit was to bring this question to but it seemed like people here might have a solution. I want to use PVC-based containers for gardening but don't want PVC's various compounds leaching into my food so I'm trying to figure out if there's a good barrier that doesn't add problems of its own. So far all I've come up with is lining it with (real) cellophane that I already had but given that it's not a flat surface this will be a kinda bunched up gift wrap looking solution. I'm interested to know if there's a more seamless solution, like an eco-friendly coating I could paint on that would act as an effective barrier without bringing its own issues into the mix.\n\nThoughts?"

I used to go to Starbucks a lot, but canned coffee and all its glory is what really made me switch. Not only does it take temperature well, but it's more sustainable in my opinion, because its recycled. Most vending machines in Japan have a recycling container for cans built in or nearby, so its just really easy to recycle. \n\nSans the vending machine bit, what do you guys think about the coffee, and is it more sustainable than a traditional coffee shop, or otherwise larger, plastic coffee container?

This is half-rant, half-trying to spark a conversation where we share thoughts on the subject.\n\nSo yeah, *""find better friends""* might work, but here I mostly mean people you *don't* choose - like work colleagues and family.\n\nWhenever people in a group get super excited for someone's new useless gadget, or way-too-frequent flights for a weekend away... I'm just unable to project this excitement back to them. And of course I can understand that something which doesn't bring me joy can bring joy to someone else. But any happiness of their happiness is just completely overshadowed by the nagging thought at the back of my head saying ""what you're doing is killing us all"".\n\nAnd then there are conversations which completely normalise bad stuff happening, where I know that by saying something would make me the moralistic asshole. Like when the work secret santa email (don't even get me started on secret santa itself) said ""hopefully most people have Amazon prime"". No. No, no, no. Hopefully most people **don't** have Amazon prime supporting a horrible company which feeds people's unhealthy habits. Or how everyone laughs when that one guy who always goes out of his way to joke how his meals will need to be 100% meat whenever anyone talks about a vegetarian option. Of course he is the asshole here but it doesn't matter, because bringing this serious stuff up as everyone is laughing in a casual conversation will put **me** in the wrong.\n\nAnd all that is ok when it's occasional.

oypzhu,"Reduce Food Waste Tips Some people on here might just be getting started on being more sustainable. Here are my best tips on reducing your food waste. It is easy to get started.\n\n* Love your leftovers! Make food that you want to eat more than once rather than throwing out what is left when the meal is over.\n* Expiration dates aren’t always exactly right. Use your best judgement!\n* Keep track of what is in your fridge and pantry. This will ensure you don’t buy too much and you know what you have to work with.\n* Use prep scraps (apple cores, veggie peels, etc.) for other projects such as making a homemade broth.\n* Don’t forget to compost! \n\nAny other suggestions to reduce food waste?"
oyr7j1,"Low- or Equivalent-Cost Sustainable swaps? I've been looking at sustainable and low-waste solutions with hearts in my eyes for years. I adore the concept, and would really love to be a part of a change for good.\n\nExcept... I don't make a ton of money. Most of the available sustainable products and solutions simply aren't *financially* sustainable for me. And it honestly breaks my heart. I want to be a part of this and do what I can, but I *can't.* It reasonably makes enough sense that there's a cost involved with doing the right thing for the planet, but what about those of us who can't afford it?\n\nAs an example, the most recent thing I looked into was Who Gives A Crap toilet paper. The best deal you can get from them levels out to $1/roll (plus $4.20 for shipping). Which doesn't seem too bad upfront, until i remember that I currently get 12 rolls at the local grocery store for $2.50, and spend the rest of the difference on *food and such.*\n\nWhat are some sustainable lifestyle changes that *don't* have an upcharge? What sustainable options are truly available to *everyone* in the same capacity?\n\n***And now, a fun discussion question:***\n\nI know it's been well-discussed that the sustainable option is nearly always more expensive, almost making sustainability a privilege exclusive to those who can afford it. But does anyone see that changing in the future? Will there always be an additional cost associated with this? I keep telling myself that part of it must be business costs – namely marketing to people who don't know your product is an option. But I don't know that I'm convinced that this will ever level itself back out. I'd love to hear some other takes on this!"

oyxj9j,"Durbin: We Must Protect Communities From “Forever Chemicals” Contamination Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal Includes Funding For PFAS Cleanup And Prevention Measures, Historic Investments In Clean Water\n\nWASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) today spoke on the Senate floor about a recent story in the Chicago Sun-Times that revealed the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) – also known as “forever chemicals” – in water systems in Chicago, Lake Forest, Waukegan, and South Elgin. \nDurbin called on the Senate to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, which includes $10 billion to address PFAS and other emerging contaminants in drinking water and wastewater, with $4 billion specifically for addressing PFAS in drinking water.\n\n“Forever chemicals.  It’s a phrase that sounds both ambiguous and ominous,” Durbin said. “The Environmental Working Group has identified more than 1,700 potential sources in my state, from sewage treatment facilities to landfills. \nThe culprit could be anyone or a combination. As of now there is no definitive answer. In other words, the analogy is an arsonist still running through the forest, and the only signs are the trees he leaves burning.”\n\nDurbin continued, “When it comes to protecting our children's health and well-being, solutions cannot wait and states like Illinois cannot address this threat on their own. \nPending before the United States Senate at this moment is the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal. This deal is good for us, good for America, and starts to address this problem. \nThis historic bipartisan plan will make our nation's largest ever investment in clean water. \nThat investment includes $10 billion for addressing the ‘forever chemical’ challenge and other emerging contaminants from drinking water and wastewater systems throughout America. \nThat's a big deal.”\n\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to re-build our nation’s roads, railways, transit, and bridges; \nto make high-speed internet and clean water a reality for every household in America; and to create millions of good-paying, family-supporting union jobs across the country.  \nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal is currently being debated on the Senate floor.\n\nThe $10 billion in PFAS funding includes:\n\n$4 billion to address PFAS in drinking water through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund;\n\n$5 billion for small and disadvantaged communities to address emerging contaminants, including PFAS and;\n\n$1 billion to address emerging contaminants, including PFAS, in wastewater through the Clean Water State Revolving Fund.\n\n\n**OP**\nThere are many different approaches \nto help clean up the PFAS mess. We are following closely \nBioLargo’s AEC Advantages over other technologies:\n\n	▪	More energy-efficient\n	▪	More affordable on per-gallon basis\n	▪	Much less PFAS-laden waste produced\n	▪	Less activated carbon required in PFAS life cycle\n	▪	Higher purity of final water\n	▪	Compact; small footprint\n\n\nDo your own DD and invest accordingly.\n\nRecommended AEC Post from Woodland Report :\n\n[**AEC advancing - BioLargo top Clean Tech investing choice**](https://woodlandreport.com/2021/08/biolargo-blgo-water-cleaning-technology-could-bring-clean-water-for-all/)\n\n#PFAS #Cleanwater #bipartisan #foreverchemicals #water #esg #cleantech"

ozhewm,"Ideas for Climate Action at Multi-Billion Dollar Food Services Group Hello Everybody,\n\nI'm very excited!\n\nI've been working for a one of the largest international food services groups in the world for a little under a year. Me and a manager a few levels above me have managed to secure the green light to plan and propose significant climate action within the group. At the moment the plans are in the ""ideation"" phase, but the support from the highest levels of the group are described as ""extremely enthusiastic""; apparently they feel like an environmental reckoning is coming and they want to get ahead of it. The group has over 55000 locations in over 45 countries that serve over 5.5 billion meals a year so the potential for this is huge.\n\nWith that said, I'd greatly appreciate any wisdom and knowledge you guys have in making food sustainable and pushing sustainability in large organizations.\n\nHere's some of what we have so far for reference:\n\n* The group don't know when and where they emit carbon - our first steps will be to measure, estimate, and guess these values (in that order of preference)  \n\n   * Direct Emissions: Plant sensors in our locations to calculate carbon emissions from resources like gas and electricity.\n   * Secondary Emissions: Estimate carbon foot of supply chains e.g. food from local sources vs international, delivered by truck vs train etc.\n   * Waste: Record how much food/water is wasted in warehouses and locations\n* Using the data:  \n\n   * Use location resource sensor readings to incentivize swap over to renewable suppliers and reduce overall usage.\n   * Conglomerate the data in a ""Hub"" Website/App with analytics to tell location/sector managers their ""carbon per meal"" and attempt to produce an app that would ""gamify"" managers reducing their carbon footprints. E.g. source your food more locally and get a discount or supply preference.\n* Other Solutions:  \n\n   * This hub could also be a place for the voices of all our workers to present their ideas to reduce waste and carbon emissions in the company. Often the workers on the ground have the closest view of the waste that the company is creating and would have good ideas on how to do better. This could be incentivized.\n   * Massive amounts of food is potentially lost in warehouses, using a model to estimate when food will be wasted we could potentially price food to reduce the likelihood of it being wasted.\n   * Food waste could be composted and sent to organic farms (or better regenerative farms)\n\nAs you can tell, a lot of our ideas are data driven, we're from the data team so that's how our brains work; I feel very strongly, however, that data will only be part of this solution and we'll need people and perspective from everywhere to make this work.\n\nThings I'm struggling to come up with solutions for:\n\n* How to incentivize organic or regeneratively grown produce, it's healthy and better for the environment by a mile but it's also often more expensive\n* How to incentivize vegan or vegetarian food being served\n* How to fight the ""plentiful"" fallacy: Food sells much better if it appears plentiful. Think of a buffet, the pasta looks a lot better when it heaped in a big pile vs the last scraps on the bottom of the serving pan. This causes huge amounts of food waste as you're nearly always throwing away full-ish pans at the end of day.\n\nWhat techniques, skills, methods have you found were successful in your workplaces? All comments, thoughts, and experience welcome :)\n\nEDIT:\n\nI think a lot of the effective solutions will be fighting human psychology e.g. avoiding the ""plentiful"" fallacy as mentioned above, or convincing a buyer that they don't need double stock and that it's predicted they will only need 1.2X stock when making their orders, etc."

Hey everyone,\n\nI am doing a survey and I am super curious to learn about any of the problems you might be facing with your sustainable shopping experiences, what you want/value the most as a shopper and if there are any impediments along the way?\n\nAre prices high turn offs? Lack of products in a particular category? Shipping times/prices? \n\nWhat would you like to see improved and changed?\n\nThanks so much in advance!"
p1xc2b,"How do you reconcile your job with your sustainability beliefs? Sorry if the title is weird, I’m not quite sure how to phrase the question. But what I mean is, I have never worked in sustainability or climate change spaces, despite really wanting to. I’ve applied to many nonprofits and private companies focused on sustainability, but no luck, and I feel like it’s a rather small and competitive industry... (also relevant, i’m not involved in science or anything so it’s hard to find any openings in like admin, etc)\n\nAnyways, I was determined to get a “green job” but it’s been over a year and no luck, so I am opening my options to just “regular” companies. But today I was interviewing at a company and asked if they have any sustainability practices or policies in place (it’s a startup so i know that many startups have a team dedicated to this). The answer was no, but if I was interested in spearheading something, I could. Which is good that they are open to that, but I was kind of surprised and put off that it seems like sustainability isn’t even on their radar as a company....\n\nI guess I am just wondering, do you all work in “green jobs”? Or do you work for regular companies too? And how do you reconcile that with your core beliefs? It’s not like I’d be working for a fossil fuel company but I still feel like I’m not doing enough if I work somewhere that isn’t completely focused on sustainability."
p1xsa0,"Leasing Electric Car VS Carbon Sequestration My SO and I have been offered a second hand SUV by her parents which is very kind but I'm worried about he emissions it'll produce. I want to possibly graciously reject the offer and instead get an electric car. My SO made a good point, however, would be be better off accepting the SUV and putting the money we would be spending on a lease into carbon sequestration? If we're usage and emissions are close to the average then how much would we need to sequester for it to be worth it?"

However, to really achieve impact, shouldn't we be focusing efforts in places where action/ ideas are missing or lacking? And wouldn't this mean that being a sustainability professional in smaller sized companies actually have a greater meaning and potential for impact?\n\nThis is a complicated question and I would love to hear if there are any insights into this :)"

One obvious place to improve is our packaging, currently recycled cardboard sheeting with edging and then plastic pallet-wrapped. We're looking to get all in one cardboard boxes made up from the same recycled cardboard provider though.

p54pfj,"How to measure the energy consumption of PoW crypto tokens  When assessing the power consumption of crypto tokens, the consensus protocol must be understood first and foremost. The “proof of work” procedure used for Bitcoin is used for most payment tokens. In recent years, several scientific studies have been written on the power consumption of Bitcoin. The literature distinguishes between two approaches to assess the energy consumption: the economic top-down approach and the techno-economic bottom-up approach (Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, n.d.).\n\n*Description of the top-down approach:*\n\nThis approach looks at energy consumption from an economic perspective. The underlying assumption is that miners’ revenues and costs are related. Since electricity costs are a significant component of running costs, it follows that the total electricity consumption of a cryptocurrency network must also be related to the miners’ revenues. The higher the revenue from mining, the more energy-hungry mining hardware can be operated.\n\nThe average price of a cryptocurrency over a given period multiplied by the number of coins of that cryptocurrency mined over that period plus transaction fees gives the total revenue, which is multiplied by 60% to get the electricity expenditure. This expenditure is then divided by the assumed electricity price to get an estimated electricity consumption of the network for the period under study.\n\n*Description of the bottom-up approach:*\n\nThe bottom-up approach was introduced by Bevand (2017). This approach has been taken up and further developed by several researchers. The underlying idea is that the hashrate of a network multiplied by the energy efficiency of the mining hardware and the energy efficiency of the data centres (cooling, supporting IT hardware, etc.) results in the power consumption of the network. Since the exact power consumption cannot be determined, a lower estimate (floor) and an upper estimate (ceiling) are calculated. Within the limits of this range, a best estimate is given to obtain a more realistic figure of the annual power consumption. The lower bound estimate corresponds to the absolute minimum of total electricity expenditure, based on the assumption that all miners always use the most energy-efficient equipment in the most energy-efficient data centres. The upper ceiling estimate corresponds to the absolute maximum total electricity expenditure, based on the assumption that all miners always use the least energy-efficient hardware available on the market, as long as the operation of the devices is still profitable. In addition, the energy efficiency factor of the data centre is raised. The best estimate is based on the assumption that miners use different variants of profitable hardware instead of a single model in differently efficient data centres.\n\nThe Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) provides an up-to-date estimate of the Bitcoin network’s daily electricity load. Check it out at https://cbeci.org.\n\n**Sources:**\n\nCambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. (o. J.). Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI). https://cbeci.org/methodology/\n\nBevand, M. (2017, March10).

I understand that this is where the producer will work hard to get their way: But it is for the safety of our consumer that its wrapped in plastic!

The producer says: we want to give the people 10 slices of cheese servings of such size and weight. It has to be fresh and not damaged. Its important that the consumer can see the product. It should be easy to open and easy to use. \n\nThe packaging entity: ok, it can have a transparant plastic container of so and so size, sealed off.

I see these news of different countries and groups who are pledging to plant tress by however many number. Of course restoring ecosystems and planting tress that will help us in the long term to combat climate change is wonderful news (especially rewilding). However, whenever I see a country like China or other high economic powers who pledge these deals I always feel sceptic as to what is their true intention in doing so especially when they don't seem to tackle issues that contribute to climate change. Instead I'm afraid that these 'solutions' might be used as an excuse to not change the system but rather like a really bad bandage of ""why do we need to change the system when there is no problem since we are planting trees that will combat the 'problem' in the first place"". \n\nOf course to truly combat climate change and remove CO2 only through trees  you would need at least 3 trillion trees?

p98ph1,"ESG &amp; Impact Investing-Death March in Wrong Direction, but slower I am increasingly see more people being openly critical and not pursuing a politically correct response to the powers that be around slow incremental improvement of societal and environmental challenges. It seems that many are following Howard Beale’s yawp from 1976 Sidney Lumet’s Movie Network.Sidney Lumet, 1976 - “[I'm Mad As Hell and I'm Not Gonna Take This Anymore!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRuS3dxKK9U)”. \n\nWhen TBLi started 25 years ago to change the financial system so it worked for multiple stakeholders, we had tremendous pushback from Asset owners, managers, service providers, rating agencies, etc. Many think it was smooth sailing in Europe. The opposite is true. I remember being asked to speak to Dutch insurance industry when TBLi started about climate risk. I said “The Netherlands is below sea level. Sea Level are going to rise, I would be concerned.” The answer I got from the audience showed how low level of awareness existed. “It not a problem for us if sea level rises. We don’t cover salt water damage.” I told that insurance executive “that is true but you give mortgages. If 200.000 homes are under water, you have a big financial disaster”. We have come a long way. Unfortunately the money flows and definition has given a false sense of success. I think we have failed miserably. We need Investing 2.0 that is far more regenerative in nature.\n\nBased upon the money flows, one would say it has been a resounding success. “ESG assets may hit $53 trillion by 2025, a third of global AUM” according to Bloomberg Intelligence February 23, 2021 In addition, there never has been so much attention via media, business schools, policy makers, impact network associations, conferences, press releases talking about ESG and Impact. We won! Or did we.\n\nThe assorted Social Investment Forums claim 40 Trillion dollars committed to ESG, already, in one shape or form. Are these figures accurate?\n\nIs so much money really going into ESG and Impact, or is the definition incorrect? ESG and Impact have become synonymous with a membership card to a fitness club but never going. Has any of this money really addressed the challenges that they were intended to help, fix or address? \n\nThe environmental and societal challenges the world faces, after all the trillions going into ESG, are staggering. ESG and Impact Investing can’t lay claim to making things better, if you look at the list.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Climate Change Destruction\n* Biodiversity loss\n* Water Shortage\n* Food shortage\n* Health Crisis (Diabetes)\n* Income Inequality (Living Wage)\n* Pollution\n* Threat of War \n\nAll of the above have grown significantly despite the money flows that were intended to reverse the trend.\n\nWhat is ESG?\n\nA family office in Singapore asked me to stop by to discuss ESG and Impact Investing, as this family were transitioning from intensive fossils fuels to sustainability. The head of the Family Office said “Robert. We don’t understand how can the most toxic companies score so well on ESG Sustainability Indexes:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* BP &amp; Shell-Carbon intensive and climate change criminals\n* Unilever-Semi-toxic cosmetics and processed food.\n* Pepsico-Diabetes from snacks and sugar water”\n\nI had to explain that the methodology used for ESG assessment is not what the company does but how it reports. \n\nEngagement\n\nIf one looks at institutional investors like pension funds, they began claiming ESG alignment because they were engaging with the companies through intermediaries. Engagement was very popular as nothing had to change, the pension funds maintained their positions and an intermediary spoke to the companies that the asset owner wanted to see behavioural change. Were they really changing the behaviour of the companies to address climate risk? Not really.\n\nImpact and ESG Network organisations were building up their members who all were claiming commitment to ESG and Impact. If you “pull up the kimono”, nothing substantial is there. Often empty gestures, but all want to be seen as part of the club, because that is where the money flows were going. Don’t want to miss the party.\n\nThe ones who have benefitted from ESG and Impact Investing are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Fund managers (fees)\n* Inst. Investor Box Tickers \n* Aspirational Club Members\n* Service Providers\n* Advisors\n\nSociety and the environment has not benefitted.\n\n**Wealth Managers and Nextgen**\n\nOn top of the present ESG failure in addressing societal and environmental challenges, the Wealth Management industry has missed the boat in embracing regenerative or investing 2.0. Most of the major private banks, are saying how important sustainable investment is. Yet, for all its importance, why is it that not one major private bank dominates the space. Main reason is that none of these institutions want to the seen as the Impact Bank (Investing 2.0), yet they also don’t want to be not seen as the impact Bank. Commitment is not there.\n\nIn addition, most wealth managers miss the opportunity that purpose driven investments provide. With low interest rates, it’s hard to truly get clients inspired. Impact (Investing 2.0) could offer a way to engage with clients, even if it represents a small percentage of portfolio. Sure Impact Investing instills passion and excitement, even if the amount is small. Finally, the coming transfer of wealth to next geners, offers an even greater opportunity to truly move money into investments that are restorative in nature.Gen Z values are not only financially focused. They want to align their values with their investments. As education and infrastructure for Investing 2.0 increases, the market will grow even faster. \n\nThe market is clearly there but the way ESG is done now is just a death march in the wrong direction but slower. Going forward, investment needs to be regenerative in nature. Fortunately, many asset owners are realising this and demanding investment that is regenerative in nature or far less harmful. This message was clearly made with the announcement of the launch of [Net Zero Asset Managers](https://www.netzeroassetmanagers.org/) The Net Zero Asset Managers initiative is an international group of asset managers committed to supporting the goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. I hope this is another empty promise wrapped in a shiny press release. We have had enough of that. Let’s stop the ribbon cutting and grab the shovel and do the work and **get mad as hell.**\n\n“There is no more neutrality in the world, you either have to be part of the solution or you’re going to be part of the problem — there ain’t no middle ground.”\n\n[Eldridge Cleaver](https://www.doublequotes.org/quotes/authors/eldridge-cleaver/)"

Found a r/lowcar but that seems very US centric and dors not fit my question. Let me know if you think there's a better place for this.\n\nI'm a consultant in central Europe. Part of my income is a company car, that gets changed every 4-5 years. I can opt out and receive either (a very small amount of) money or public transport/electric bike, however I'm then expected to be able to arrange transportation to my client based on that choice and, given that I change clients at variable frequencies (3mos to a year per client) and changing my transportation plan with my employer takes at least 1 month, I choose to stay with a car and will simply not use it if that's possible and my client is close by.\n\nNow, I'm due for a car change and my employer is offering three car models: petrol, non plug in hybrid and EV.\n\nOf course an EV has 0 emissions and given my area has quite some charging stations and I don't plan to drive more than 200km a day with it, that seems like a good fit. However I'm worried since I know producing an electric car has a high environmental cost which apparently isn't recovered if you don't use it enough. With working from home and given that I live in the capital (well connected, close to many possible clients) I think I'm likely to drive 100km/week max, though a situation in which I drive 800km/week is not impossible.\n\nThe hybrid on the other hand, since it isn't plug in, will mostly run on fuel as I'm driving on highways 90% of the time, as I only use my car for my work commute, if necessary. I read somewhere that hybrid cars use more fuel than other cars when they are running on fuel, but then I also read the opposite of that.\n\nI don't know how to make this decision and most of the online comparisons I found consider things that don't apply to me, like the price of the car or tax cuts, or the number of car models in each category.\n\nIs my info correct? What would you do if you were me? Do you have information about hybrid and EV cars that I didn't touch upon and you think could be useful? Should I compare the environmental impact of the two precise car models instead of category (is that feasible)?\n\nShould I move away from trying to pick the least environmentally damaging car, as which is which is hard to ascertain, and choose based on other criteria?"

The price difference is not huge, so I wonder which one of these options I should pick.\n\nI am interested in their overall net environmental impacts, i.e. how these types of packaging differ not only in terms of recycling, but also in terms of pollution generated during production (e.g. CO2 emitted, toxic waste generated etc.).\n\nSo, which one is the lesser evil?\n\n[sources are always welcome]"

Cheap flights are often disgraced as being bad for the environment as people tend to fly more whit having those cheap Wizzair/Ryanair flights \n\nHowever, if you think about it, if everyone would want to fly at only 9€ there wouldn’t be a lot of flights, there would rather be no flights at all.\n\nFor an airline a 9€ doesn’t make money, not even for Ryanair. Therefore, by buying a 9€ flight you don’t really contribute to the demand as there is really limited supply for such cheap flights. It’s more flights that cost 50-100€ that drive the demand, not the rock bottom prices at below 20€ Ryanair needs to make at least 40-50€ in revenue in order to break even.\n\nIn conclusion, if you hop on a 9€ flight you just make use of a flight that’s happening anyway, created by people who are willing to pay more. You make use of the supply that is already there but you do not drive demand.\n\nDo you agree/do you disagree?"

pbfbvk,"Prioritizing home improvements to improve sustainability I live in the Deep, Humid South, home about 2500 sq ft that's about 15 years old.  I have a 5.0 kw solar panel array that's about 6 years old, but no whole home battery.  Two HVAC systems, and two (brand new, high efficiency plastic tank) hot water heaters.  The solar panels only produce about ¼ to ⅓ of the power we use... yes, it's hot here, and I know the HVAC systems installed weren't the most efficient.  \n\nOf course we've done the easy tasks, high efficiency shower heads, LED lighting, smart thermostats, recently replaced weather stripping, etc.  But looking at my next steps to be more environmentally responsible, I'd like to first get spray foam insulation blown in the attic.  My understanding is that it drastically improves the efficiency of a home.  Then in a few years I plan on having the two HVAC systems replaced with high efficiency units.  Perhaps the power savings from those options will mean it'll be more viable to get a whole-home battery to use with the solar panels in the event of hurricanes knocking the power out, etc.  \n\nThese are obviously all larger cost investments that I'll have to spread out over a number of years, but I'm curious if folks more in the know feel that this is the best way or order of things to become more environmentally responsible.  And of course this goes hand in hand with trying my hand at hydroponics to grow my own vegetables, planting a small garden in back of the house, and consciously cutting down on waste.  Ultimately I want to use fewer resources in the small space of this earth that I occupy."

I looked around and couldn’t find a brand that resonated with me that was made locally ,eco friendly and affordable so I created BBcierva. BB was inspired by a multitude of influences. Common themes that support bb are sustainability, nature, spirituality, space and science.\n\nThe collections feature designs that are hand crafted for the perfect fit, and colours that will inspire positivity. Each bikini is **handmade by me in the UK** and each season captures a theme of colours, that relate to specific ideas. The first season features shades of blue and were named after the the lost city/continent of Atlantis, Lemuria and the flying island Laputa.\n\n**Sustainability** 💧🌍\n\n8 million tonnes of waste are discarded in our oceans &amp; 640 thousand tons of fishing nets are abandoned at the bottom of the ocean EVERY YEAR.\n\nBBcierva is committed to working with high end recycled fabrics made from ECONYL: a 100% regenerated nylon yarn derived from discarded fishing nets and other textile waste. This fabric can be recycled infinitely without losing quality, supporting a circular fashion industry. Using regenerated nylon also helps to clean the seas where entanglement in abandoned nets causes the deaths of many thousands of whales, dolphins and other marine life every year.\n\n**Packaging:**\n\nBB is also dedicated to recycled and biodegradable packaging. Each step of packaging the bikinis has been carefully chosen to ensure sustainability. More details are on the website if you wish to look further.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this!! &lt;3 \n\nFollow on -  \n\ninsta: [www.instagram.com/bbcierva](https://www.instagram.com/bbcierva/?hl=en)\n\npinterest: [https://www.pinterest.co.uk/bbcierva](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/bbcierva/_created/)\n\ntiktok: [https://www.tiktok.com/@bbcierva](https://www.tiktok.com/@bbcierva?traffic_type=google&amp;referer_url=amp_bbcierva&amp;referer_video_id=6986570580694666502) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nlove xoxo"

I've spent loads of time reflecting and feel really disillusioned by my overall job because it lacks purpose.

The program looks pretty new (only launched last year) and has a pretty hefty price tag but I'm gravitating towards it because well, Oxford.

But in some devices, e.g. the TV remote, the rechargeable batteries last so long that they will only be recharged a few times before failing due to old age. I was wondering if non-rechargeable batteries could not be better in such cases after all?\n\nAlso, with some devices you have the choice between buying them with integrated Lithium rechargeable batteries or using disposible coin cells. Same question here, at which point is a rechargeable lithium battery more sustainable than using coin cells?\n\nObviously, the most sustainable thing is to use less battery powered devices at all."

I have been thinking about offsetting some of my carbon emissions by allocating money each month to a suitable carbon-offsetting activity. I have landed on making either monthly or annual donations to reforestation projects.\n\nI have estimated that I emit about 7.2 tons of CO2 annually just from driving around ( 15 gal/tank \* 1 tank/week \* 53 weeks/year, rounding up \* 9kg of CO2/gal = \~7.2 tons of CO2 from driving).\n\nI am considering donating to [onetreeplanted](https://onetreeplanted.org/collections/asia/products/mangroves) to plant mangroves because I care specifically about protecting coastlines and apparently mangroves have great carbon sequestration and storage potential.\n\nI am thinking of donating to plant 50 mangrove trees a month ($50/month). Of course a tree sequesters carbon throughout its entire lifetime, so I  figure that eventually the cumulative carbon sequestration rate of all the trees I fund will exceed my emission rate and I will become net-negative. \n\nDoes this make sense? Is onetreeplanted the best organization to donate toward? I suppose at some point it's a matter of faith and trust that they are using my funds for their stated purpose. I'm just wondering if there are better ways for me to spend that same amount of cash ($600/year) that will either provide equivalent carbon offsets and more immediate/proximate feedback.

pfk173,"To stay under 1.5/2C we have to render millions of dollars of fossil fuel assets worthless. How do you think we can do this in a just and responsible way that is also global in scale and rapid in deployment? &gt; The various carbon budgets give some sense of just how much is at risk for energy producers, including the state-owned energy companies. In the best case for them, a rise of 3C, almost all of the remaining carbon stock — 96 per cent — could be burnt. But at the lower bound of 1.5C, using the IPCC allowance, a mere 16 per cent of the carbon is usable. In other words, over 80 per cent of carbon in the ground would be stranded and theoretically worthless. Even at 2C, 59 per cent of fossil fuel reserves would be stranded.

Can we afford it? What will the economic consequences be? Would we need a binding global trade ban against fossil fuels for certain uses or some other mechanism? How would we enforce compliance? What industries can we simply not transition out of in time?

It's about the same cost as me making it at home but it means more plastic in the home. Another example is loose spinach which I purchase using my own produce bags. Sometimes they have spinach bags reduced to $1/500g bag vs $13/kg. I re-purpose the plastic bag to hold waste or as a produce bag on my next trip.\n\nEven though I make a conscious effort, my mind goes through this thought process every time\n\n* Purchasing the item eliminates it from going to a landfill\n* But the packaging it comes in (plastic most of the time) still goes to landfill\n* This means I am supporting the business by purchasing their product\n\nHow can I stop this thought process on every trip?"

I lay down my thoughts, and if it doesn't make sense my apologies in advance.\n\nFor a family of 5 my total emissions are 40 t/y. This is already much better than the average in my area per the calculator I used. But I think by reducing car use and making housing efficient, I can bring it down to maybe 10t/y. For this:\n\n* Move to Washington state because the weather is relatively mild and as global warning rages, it would be livable for a long time. Currently I am in CA and between draughts and fires, I think this state is going to be unlivable in my lifetime.\n* Housing should be built to offset its emissions completely. I have seen a project near LA that is doing it, so it is possible. Not looking to live a spartan life. Would like to use tech to make things comfortable - solar panels, geo-thermal etc, \n* Currently I have a single family home, and I think it is very inefficient. Would like to live in a community where housing is dense and shopping, eating etc. is walkable. I immigrated from India and I really love this model. Hate taking car out every time I need to buy milk or bread.\n* Work from home so that commute will also be avoided.\n* Do not live in big/expensive areas. Prefer a community that is not as expensive as Seattle area.\n* housing to be built to a spec/code that can endure increasingly volatile weather of future. The houses and infra should be built to last several hundred years.\n\nI think there are probably already many projects like this and I would like to be a part of a community, and not a lone wolf.\n\nLast but not the least, I am flexible in my requirements. Will learn and adapt."

The recipes are made up of the same 3,000 ingredients.\n* Using government and industry databases, I added calorie and carbon emission data for each ingredient. For example, every 1 kg of bananas that you eat generates 0.798 kg of CO2 (based on the production, transportation to store, etc.) and has 890 calories.\n* Recipes were grouped based on common diet habits and carbon intensity. For example, all recipes with chicken, turkey or duck were grouped as poultry.\n* I then calculated the carbon emissions per calorie for each recipe group. For example, the median carbon emissions per calorie from poultry recipes is 0.004 kg.\n* I estimate your carbon emissions based on how frequently you eat foods in these groups, caloric intake, how frequently you eat restaurant meals, drink coffee, and get delivery.\n* The result is the number of metric tons of carbon that your diet produces each year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI created this to help others become more aware of how their diet impacts the environment and to see if there’s interest in an app that lets you find low carbon food.

phme9o,"Does not owning a vehicle offset never recycling? So I know someone who runs an electronics repair business and says that since he is a single dad and has 3 kids, he doesn't have time to take the e-waste he produces to the proper disposal location. And he says that since he would have to take recycling down 5 flights of stairs and walk across a large parking lot to reach the central recycling bins of the apartment complex he lives in, he never does recycling either and just throws everything in the garbage (there is central garbage disposal on each floor). However, he says that since he doesn't own a vehicle, therefore that alone more than offsets the amount of waste he has improperly disposed of. \n\nEven though I am all about disposing waste properly, I emphasize with his situation and realize that it is not fair to force somebody in such life circumstances (of which it isn't their fault), to properly recycle. \n\nThis got me thinking, since this is actually relevant to how wealthy ppl say that they recycle and compost much more than average, and often has the time and money to properly dispose waste (motor oil to a proper location, e-waste to a proper location, construction supplies to a specialized location, etc). However, since wealthy people often own more cars and drive more, and the cars they own often pollute more either due to high performance or physical materials (a Rolls Royce probably has a carbon footprint 10x larger than Honda Civic, for example), does the fact that they dispose of everything properly offset the fact that their lifestyle inherently pollutes more? \n\nAnd this also relates to the ""reduce, reuse, recycle"" order of importance whereas reduce has a larger impact than reuse, and reuse which in turn has a larger impact than recycle. I think the fact that the aforementioned person doesn't have a car, and lives in an apartment (not a nice one either, but realize that I am not judging him, just merely stating the facts) means that he is massively ""reducing"" which offsets how he is not recycling. \n\nFinally, this also relates to the truth about how ppl in developing countries such as India, don't have large scale recycling facilities generally speaking, but since they don't buy much in the first place, and tend to have well-established reusing systems (families will pass items to another family, for example), developing countries have significantly lower carbon footprint per capita."

Are any of the power sources that we currently use \*actually\* sustainable in the long run? It seems like they all have problems.   \n\n\nI am in no way an expert so I'm trying to understand renewable energy better. From what I understand, solar panels are made from nonrenewable minerals, and have a lifespan of only about 30 years. Wind turbines require a lot of steel and concrete, and the blades are usually made of plastic. They also only last about 30 years, and can harm wildlife. Hydro also uses huge amounts of concrete, and disrupt ecosystems. Nuclear energy of course produces radioactive waste.   \n\n\nThe only truly sustainable options I can think of are traditional windmills and water wheels made of wood, because wood is renewable indefinitely. And of course human powered tools (hand cranked, for example). But obviously these traditional methods are not nearly efficient enough to be used on a mass scale. Should we go back to a low tech society so that we rely less on electricity? What are your thoughts on this?"

plzdtp,"Reusable vs Disposable Diapers My husband and I are pregnant with our first and I recently started looking into cloth diapers. My thought is they are great from an environmental waste saving perspective and bonus they are cheaper in the long run, especially if you use them for future kids! A few days ago my husband brought up the amount of additional water needed with cloth diapers, since you are doing a load of laundry at least every two days. Now I know water goes into making disposable diapers as well but since we live in drought ridden CA I figured this was worth investigating. Has anyone looked into this, any data on if cloth diapering really uses a lot of extra water and if so does it still out weigh the landfill waste of disposable diapers? Lastly any tips from anyone who has tried reusable cloth diapers? :)"

pmbgoo,"Why carbon offsets may be a bad thing I saw a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/pkur8l/offsetting_your_carbon_footprint_for_or_against/) asking what people on this sub thought about carbon offsets, and was surprised not to see the point I’m going to make:\n\nWe have already emitted 660 billion tons of carbon (equivalent to 2420 billion tons of CO2). In order to mitigate climate change, in addition to lowering and eventually ceasing all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, we must suck up carbon from the atmosphere. \n\nThere are nature-based ways to do so: ecosystem restoration, and in particular reforestation. Forests can only store a finite amount of carbon: after a few decades to a century, forests reach an equilibrium and as much carbon is emitted by decomposing vegetation as is sucked in by growing trees.\n\nMoreover, the surface on which we can reforest (or even afforest) is limited. Even when being [over-optimistic](https://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aay7976), reforestation [could only offset one-third](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/76) of our historical emissions. In summary, we have 150 years’ worth of emissions to offset, and insufficient means to do so. \n\nNow how do carbon offsetting fits into all this? In my opinion, it gives social license to further emit GHG. It basically makes something that is slowly getting unacceptable, fully acceptable again. But no harm is done since all the GHG emitted in my name are offset right? Well, for the reasons I outlined above, this is not true. Each gram of carbon we allow ourselves to emit today under the pretext that it will be offset means that a gram emitted yesterday will not be sequestered and will continue to warm the planet, with known consequences.\n\nFor emissions that we can’t avoid, I imagine offsetting may be worth it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is without mentioning several other issues with carbon offset, some of which were in the comments of the post I mentionned :\n\n1) Emissions occur instantaneously, whereas trees and soils take several years and up to decades to store the same amount of carbon. As we’re already experiencing increased frequency and/or intensity of extreme weather events, it is unclear if we can afford to add additional carbon in the atmosphere, even if it’s for “only” a few years or decades.\n\n2) I think sometimes mono-tree fields are planted as carbon offsets. Obviously, the benefits in terms of biodiversity, but also in terms of carbon storage and other ecosystem services of monocrops are much lower compared to an actual forest. Another point if that coniferous trees are often planted because they grow quickly. But they also have super low albedo. At some latitudes, they may thus warm more the planet through lower albedo than they cool it through reduced greenhouse effect.\n\n3) I think sometimes trees are not properly taken care of after being planted (if they are even planted), so won’t ever fulfil their role as carbon offsets.\n\n4) Carbon offsets fully shift the responsibility from the industry and the companies to individuals. Most often, the responsibility is shared."
pmc5vh,"Bamboo business Just trying to evaluate some ideas here.\n\nI have a job that most people would consider nice, I enjoy it too. I can't complain and live relatively well. Yet I feel permanent guilt about how we're destroying and murdering this planet, the climate catastrophe, the pollution, all this stuff. It's an ever growing fear and frustration, there's hardly a day I'm not thinking about it. I'd like to be active.\n\nOne thing that absolutely blows my mind is the amount of plastic packaging materials we're throwing away every week. Quite many things have been changing in this area in the past years but there's still a lot to be done.\n\nI thought it would be nice to start a small business to produce bamboo and then produce packaging materials out of it. My advantages are none and my challenges are (1) I know nothing about farming, (2) I'm 52 and I've never been an entrepreneur, (3) I know very little about bamboo specifically.\n\nCan someone lead me to some businesses and openly available information on this topic? What types of bamboo are feasible (economically) to produce? What type of soil do they like? What is the yield in a continental (rather dry) climate? Are there any know manufacturing methods that are especially good with bamboo?\n\nOf course I will jump on Google repeatedly in the following days and weeks but I'm hoping there's someone here with structured knowledge or good pointers to it.\n\nPS: this is Central/Eastern Europe here."

pmh8be,"Are there any calculations or statistics that give us a picture of a situation where every single ""ordinary"" person/household would go sustainable/zero-waste/zero-emission etc.? Sorry if this question has already been asked and answered.\n\nI've been wondering this for quite some time. While you, me and our neighbor's family committing to a lifestyle and habit of reducing our impact on the impending ecological catastrophe is a great thing I think the overall impact of such actions and declarations is negligible at best. Of course I realize it's all about consciousness and teaching ourselves and the next generations about how to live and let (the environment) live. But seeing charts and numbers and stats and you name it I'm well aware that our individual actions might be nothing more than a manifest and an example for others.\n\nThe way I see it is the real impact, the real action, lies way beyond our reach in the hands of people controlling the global ""economy"". The ""citizen responsibility"" propaganda is just another tactic which not only lessens the load on the government and corporation in the whole discourse but also keeps us—the small folk—distracted and busy,\n\nLook, I really don't want to diminish anyone's efforts in becoming more aware on the topic and changing the world just around themselves. There's no doubt it's immensely valuable in the long run. But here and now it seems to me it's not really significant enough. We, as in individual people, are not really responsible for anything, we're just a part of a system that is.\n\nI mean, just looking at the reports of negative emissions, waste produce, permanent ecological damage etc. for me it's very clear that not only the responsibility but also the chance of any significant  impact lies well beyond reach of any individual person on this world.\n\nSo yeah, I keep wondering if there are any numbers on the actual predicted impact of every single household in the entire world going fully ""neutral"" for our planet. Because I have this twitching feeling that what such report would say is that none of us are able to change the situation—even if it takes all of us."

My current stance is that the current CAFO factory farmed beef production model may not be sustainable to feed the world's growing population due to environmental concerns (emissions and land usage). Their main point was that there is not enough land available for this kind of grazing in order to feed the world (in a futuristic society obviously). I then went on to quote some statistic I vaguely remember hearing that a huge amount of available farming land is not suitable for crops but is suitable for livestock grazing. To which they were like there's just no way there's enough room on the planet for each person to receive a majority of their nutrients from beef. Under no circumstance is eating top of the food chain sustainable. The conversation kinda stopped there but I was wondering if anyone has any opinions/statistics/data for this point?

pqo1dp,"What is the ideal bottling/packaging to go for in cosmetics? I was having a look online regarding the types of plastic that can be used to house cosmetics, whether it be for face or hair. I did want to start my own small shampoo brand one day. For bioplastics, I came across this after an episode of Shark Tank where a guy made a coffee machine and claimed the pods used are compostable in your garden. After having a further look, I read that it is more complicated than that. While plastics that state they are biodegradable such as polylactic acid (PLA) or anything made from plant material, industrial composts only get this done effectively, meaning the plastic otherwise largely ends up in landfill. With that being said, I had some questions about this going further.\n\n* With post consumer recycled plastic only being good for single use, although not requiring the energy as virgin plastic would, how do varying percentiles vary in terms of sustainability? I saw options online that had ranges from a cosmetic tube containing a range of options from 20-100% PCR plastic.\n* What are biodegradable additives, and what difference does this make? While it is meant to be an accelerant for microorganisms to help with decomposition, is it really a gimmick given the problem of plastic waste?\n* Would HDPE plastic really be the way to go, as it is easily recyclable over and over again? I've seen some sites endorse this as an option for now. Given of course that most bioplastics need industrial tech to decompose or rather end up in landfills.\nWhat would be the most eco-friendly and sustainable option for now?"

pqq0s2,"Carbon footprint of second hand products Confession: I recently bought a new TV. \n\nI had a certain TV model in mind and made an effort to buy it pre-owned, but due to schedule related reasons I ended up buying it new, off the shelf. Now I feel some climate-guilt for going the easy route as waiting to find a pre-owned one would have been the more sustainable way to get the TV. Now I feel like the embodied carbon of the TV is completely on me, as by making the purchase I’ve effectively said ”yes LG, please\n make one more of these televisions and ship it to the other side of the globe”.\n\nOkay enough intro: the discussion I’d like to open, the question I’d appreciate your input on is this: What would have been the environmental impact of buying the TV as pre-owned? How much would you say buying a pre-owned TV increases a persons carbon footprint? Clearly the amount is non-zero but it also seems clear that buying second-hand has a lesser impact compared to buying off the shelf. Clearly the pre-owned TV has the same embodied carbon as a new one - it’s just that I wouldnt feel as responsible for it since it kind off wasn’t shipped from Korea just for me. Buying second hand, I wouldnt be increasing demand as directly as when buying off the shelf.\n\nIt’s possible to find quite concise data on the embodied carbon of the new TV so I know reasonably well by how much it has increased my personal carbon footprint for the year - but how much better would it have been to get the pre-owned one, thats trickier to evaluate.\n\nThank you for your time and thoughts."

I am reviewing the different reporting standards for Sustainability reporting.\n\nI noticed there are few reporting frameworks like GRI, WRI GHG Protocol or ISO 16064-1,2 and 3.\n\nGRI claims that 80% of the top companies use theirs. That it is comprehensive taking into account ESG. But to me it looked pretty confusing and less practical for a company that actually wants to reduce GHG. Its great if the objective is to prepare a complex report so people would feel great.\n\nWRI claims 9 of top 10 companies in the world use their standard. Their seems to be easy to understand so may be more practical. \n\nBoth above are my opinions after reading about it from their sites. Not from actual use.\n\nTo make matters worse ISO has come out with 14064-1,2 and 3 which can be audited like other ISO and get certified by them.\n\nSo is the goal to actually solve a global problem or is this what looks like reporting wars....my is the gold standard approach ? \n\nCan someone shed some light if they have faced similar challenges or pros and cons.

prabbo,"Help me Reddit! Exciting project name needed Hi r/sustainability,\n\nLong story short is that I am fortunate enough to work on a project which has been awarded a substantial sum (multimillions over 5+ years) which is aiming to create exemplar sites which demonstrate sustainable water management on a catchment scale. Some key points for context:\n\n* This will be a project which heavily engages with communities and really seeks to champion local ownership of the benefits we want to create. We're also expecting to work with a diverse range of partners and stakeholders with shared interests/responsibilities. \n* The areas we're targeting are generally smaller, rural areas which would struggle to attract funding for these sorts of things in pretty much any other setting. There will only be a small number of communities (probably around 5-8) which are taken through to delivery since we really want to focus on strong, complete examples rather than a little bit spread over wide areas. \n* It's heavily linked to flood risk. The original idea is to capture flood water which is often just treated as ""waste"", store it, and give it a value doing by using it elsewhere. Commoditising a natural waste product essentially. Reducing flood risk to properties is a must for the project.\n* Seeking multiple benefits from lots of different subject areas also features heavily. This could be reduced domestic water consumption, improving hydrological catchment water quality, increasing/improving aquatic habitats, enriching curriculum in local schools to pass on messaging to kids etc etc.\n* When submitted for funding approval the project was called ""Holistic Water Management: Revaluing Flood Water"". It's descriptive and served its purpose, but I think we can all agree its a bit mechanical.\n* The project itself is basically a pilot. We're expected to be able to report back on what we found with the intention of demonstrating how water management could be done more sustainably in the future. Theres a big emphasis on reporting, recording, and analysis over the duration of the programme of works. \n* The project is based in the UK in a region (which believe it or not) suffers with water scarcity along with flood risk - which is what fundamentally drove the idea in the first place.  \n\nI'm super excited to be able to work on this because opportunities to deliver such a genuinely well intentioned, and unique project come around so rarely. But we need a name, and the project team is stuffed full of talented engineers and project managers who are not typically known for their branding creativity!\n\nSo I hoped Reddit might be able to offer suggests for a name? Short and snappy would be preferable. Maybe it could be abbreviated into something clever? While I fully acknowledge that offering the internet a chance to name something like this is risky (cue Rainy McRain Face...) I'm sure that loads of you are going to be much better at it than I am!"

prgsbi,"Best way to donate to fight climate change / offset carbon footprint? Hi all, I'm hoping this is the right sub to post this. My wife and I just drove back from our cottage, and on the way back, we started discussing on ways to offset carbon footprint from certain activities, mostly (1) driving to the cottage; and (2) traveling once per year.\n\nOn many other fronts we are already being careful (I.e.: we became vegetarian/quasi-vegan in part for environmental reasons, we try to buy as much as possible second hand, clothes that we no longer wear are either donated or turned into rags, etc.). That being said, we do go to our cottage 4-6x a year (about 450km both ways, so 1,800km to 2,700km total), and we do travel once per year (with 2020 and 2021 being obvious exceptions). We want to find the best way to donate to have an immediate/measurable impact to offset this carbon footprint, but we also find it difficult to find convincing information on the subject.\n\nSo far, our three options are:\n\n1) Donate to organizations that plant trees. I'm not really sure this is that efficient, however.\n\n2) Donate to organizations who does carbon capture, like Climeworks. Our issues with this is twofold: (1) how legit are the numbers given (I.e.: x amount of tons of CO2 removed for $Y donation), and is it really the best way to go about it? It's like we are helping with a symptom more than the underlying issue.\n\n3) Donate to organizations who lobby for the sake of the environment, such as Clean Air Task Force. Again, our issue with this is twofold: (1) Are they remotely successful in their efforts? and (2) how can we directly measure the impact our donations are having?\n\nI'm sure there are other ways. I would appreciate any guidance this sub can offer on the three ways we thought of, and on other ways we might not have."

And actually most people don't care or don't care enough to do anything about it or they just think it's all exaggerated, although the science says otherwise. And that feeling gets continually worse for me. And it seems like almost nothing changes. Profit will seemingly always be a priority over nature and consequently human lives. And while we keep talking more and more about it, the only thing that seems to happen is that large companies pretend to be more sustainable for PR without actually doing anything. \nI personally try my best to be as sustainable as possible just for my conscience and because nihilism is also not a solution, but damn it's really hard to deal with this feeling of impending doom and feeling like most people don't care. And the worst is that you even get insulted and verbally attacked sometimes, if you care about this.

Gluten-free (I have celiac), 2. Vegan, 3. Fair trade, 4. Recyclable/upcycle-able packaging (again, celiac = decent risk of cross contamination with bulk food). My ranking for “item ideals” is 1. Safe, 2. Secondhand, 3. Recycle-only packaging. If an item only fulfills one or two ideals, it has to be the first one/two. And if that means my fair-trade, certified GF coffee isn’t in recyclable packaging - oh well. It’s helped a lot with perfectionism for me. Like, I could be ashamed of still driving a gas-powered (32 MPG) car - but it’s safe and secondhand, and a lot of it can be recycled at the end of its lifespan.

puwd0c,"Is organic better for the environment? I've been reading this [article](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2019/10/22/organic-food-better-environment/), and was just wondering what your take on it is. I can't see GMOs being bad for the environment, they tend to have better yields and are genetically modified to resist pests, so there's less reliance on pesticides. But organic is a term also associated with less pesticide use and less fertilizers in general, and both pesticides and fertilizers have negative impacts such as creating deadzones and contributing to climate change. The article argues that although this is true, in many cases it also opens up more land for carbon sequestering, as organic has a larger land footprint than conventional farming. So I'm interested to hear what your informed opinions on it are."

I spent a weekend in a lower-class community, and on that Saturday, while it was raining heavily, I saw people come out to dump waste in their large community drainage system. The thought behind their actions was that the water would take it away and they wouldn't have to pay waste disposal fees that they can barely afford. \n\nSo I walked up to one of these folks and asked: where do you think the waste goes from there? She replied: Don't ask me silly questions. \n\nFast forward to the present, I decided to make that a research question: where do wastes go in Lagos Nigeria? It was a research that I did for one year, it is strictly educational and not for profit. If anyone is interested in solid waste management in Nigeria, I took the liberty of making a short film about it as well. \n\nTopics on solid waste management in the country range from waste to landfills, recycling initiatives, waste to energy, and more.

pvvreq,"Easy sustainability tip: Buy in bulk to use less packaging If you double the volume of a square container, the surface area increases by about 1.6x. This means that the container with double the product inside only has about 60% more packaging. So if you can buy the larger size, you will be producing less waste.\n\nEven if you live alone, I encourage you to experiment. When the pandemic started, my wife and I started buying coffee creamer in the half gallon (1.8 L) size, instead of the quart (900 mL) size. Between the two of us we'd drink four cups of coffee a day, plus occasional use for cooking, and we were always able to use up the cream in the larger size before it spoiled. Then, my wife stopped drinking coffee. Out of habit I kept buying the larger size -- and even still, I'm able to finish it myself before it spoils. After that, we started experimenting with larger containers of yogurt, OJ, eggs, and frozen fruits -- still no spoilage!\n\nNow, it's important to keep in mind that packaging is a pretty small portion of a food's overall environmental impact ([source](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/food-emissions-supply-chain?country=Beef+%28beef+herd%29~Cheese~Poultry+Meat~Milk~Eggs~Rice~Pig+Meat~Peas~Bananas~Wheat+%26+Rye~Fish+%28farmed%29~Lamb+%26+Mutton~Beef+%28dairy+herd%29~Shrimps+%28farmed%29~Tofu~Maize)), but if you can reduce packaging use without wasting food, it's an easy win for the environment (along with the fact that it ends up saving you money!)."

I'm 25 working at an investment firm in the DC area (although I don't really know anything about investing, nor do I care much - just deal with data). I studied Math in college and just barely missed my Sustainability minor due to an issue with clearing an internship credit... but I left college intending to try to get any job remotely related to sustainability/environmental science/conservation/etc that I could. After a while of searching, part-time retail pay wasn't paying the bills so I expanded my search and ended up at the investment firm where I've now worked for 2+ years.\n\nThe job is pretty soul-sucking and it's about time for me to move on but I'm struggling with finding a clear path forward. Prone to overthinking and perfectionism, I've waited so long to start applying to jobs because I'm afraid of being ""trapped"" in a similarly soul-sucking career (thinking: consulting \[but is that even a trap? I've heard mixed reviews\]) but I'm taking my therapists advice to not search for the perfect career and instead start by taking one step in the right direction (read: any job related to sustainability). I originally planned to start studying for the LEED Green Associate exam with hopes of passing and leveraging that to a new position in a greener field, maybe even starting at USGBC. However... as I've started doing research on it, I've seen many say it's generally useless and not worth the money. Although I'm no longer trying to look for the ""perfect"" job and I find LEED interesting, I don't want to spend a big chunk of change on something that won't help. Anyone have thoughts on the usefulness of LEED GA or any other certifications? Or any other advice for pivoting to sustainability?\n\nFor more context,  I have a couple internships from college under my belt related to sustainability, and even did my senior research project for my math degree on food waste and it's environmental impacts, but I'm a few years out of college and it's no longer the most relevant thing on my resume. Even my stat skills and programming skills from my degree feel almost non-existent at this point. I'm incredibly confident in my ability to quickly learn (or relearn) and become a stand-out employee - but obviously I need to land a job first and the relevant experience on my resume feels a bit stale. Maybe that's just me overthinking though! Greatly appreciate any advice. Thanks!"

pzb4yb,"net-zero emission bio-plastics have cost saving potential of 288Bn USD A [new study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg9853) has identified the potential to save 288Bn USD through producing net-zero plastics based on biomass and captured CO2.\n\nSee also the abstract below:\n\n&gt;Mitigating life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of plastics is perceived  as energy intensive and costly. We developed a bottom-up model that  represents the life cycle of 90% of global plastics to examine pathways  to net-zero emission plastics. Our results show that net-zero emission  plastics can be achieved by combining biomass and carbon dioxide (CO2)  utilization with an effective recycling rate of 70% while saving 34 to  53% of energy. Operational costs for net-zero emission plastics are in  the same range as those for linear fossil-based production with carbon  capture and storage and could even be substantially reduced. Realizing  the full cost-saving potential of 288 billion US dollars requires  low-cost supply of biomass and CO2, high-cost supply of oil,  and incentivizing large-scale recycling and lowering investment barriers  for all technologies that use renewable carbon feedstock."

pzh1m2,"Sustainability is not a skinny virgin vegan Sustainability is not something poverty or mediocrity oriented. You can be sustainable but still being a chad.\nTake for example 100 sqm of sea. You can harvest algae which can be used in lots of products like clothes and cosmetics. You can also combine this business with edible algae and mussels farming which is the most sustainable ""fish"" farming. Think about synthetic meat and the possibility to eat a sustaunable and ethical piece of animal for e.g. breakfast without any sense of guilty. Think about the recycle of organic materials like eggs and potatoes peels. Think about the potential of vertical farms and the quality, the safety and the sustainability of its products.\nAll of this means money and business.

q0u7ow,"Japan's Sustainable Travel &amp; Tourism Challenge is Identifying the Need for It I've been thinking a lot about future-travel and the role of sustainable travel in Japan over this last year as we don't want to go back to travel-as-usual, we want to launch more sustainable travel options. \n\nOver the last year, I've talked to Japanese business experts, guides and insiders in a daily talkshow series. Recently, was hired to talk to a group of tourism professionals in Japan. \n\nIt's been a tough year for travel and tourism professionals around the world, but many in the audience seem resistant to the idea of applying more sustainable practices to travel products and services.\n\nI've talked with many people who have the strong feeling that Japan is already balancing the needs of people-planet-profit (sustainability) and doesn't really need to deviate much from business-as-usual.\n\n[Anrakuji Temple in Hiroshima Japan - surviving A-bombed Gingko tree allowed to grow through the beautiful traditional wooden Temple Gate](https://preview.redd.it/e9dhfdzn4br71.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87c75597994859fa06c0782a3e8c90a623547eb5)\n\nAlthough there are many wonderful examples of sustainability in practice in business and travel in Japan, they are few and far between. In short,[Japan has one of the highest percentages of plastic use per person, 2nd highest after the US, and new regulation is on the way to encourage more reusables by 2025.](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20210602/p2a/00m/0sc/023000c)\n\nIn the travel sector, there are currently so many reasons to change to improve the quality of life of locals as well as appeal to international (inbound) visitors. \n\nSome Japanese businesses and travel industry professionals, however, still don't seem to see any reason to create more value for the sustainable travel seeking visitor. Finding ways to use tourism to create value for the local community and/or environment rarely finds its way into discussions. \n\n# Travel Professionals Need To Travel More\n\nMany travel professionals I work with do what they do with the utmost efficiency, but many lack experience in being a traveler– they rarely spend any time traveling in Japan or abroad (even before covid). It is also rare to meet someone applying work SDG targets to home life, or engaged in researching best-practice and innovation in travel and tourism in Japan or abroad. How can you judge what travelers want and need without trying it out for yourself?\n\n# New Appeal for Sustainable Japanese Heritage \n\nI love working with Japanese guides and travel professionals who are open to trying out new ideas, even if they are old as I suggest my admiration for traditional Japanese concepts of sustainability and how they might be applied to modern life, work and travel. \n\nFor example, the concepts of [Satoyama,](https://youtu.be/JcRHvWe4JuM) [Shojin-Ryori,](https://youtu.be/8p7yq7oYRbE) and practices of the [Edo-period](https://youtu.be/f-hk1NOeopU) are more relevant now than ever before. \n\nI love the example of macrobiotic cuisine, how the concept was created in Japan, but only became popular abroad before coming back to Japan– we will see the same thing happen with traditional Japanese models of reuse and repair. \n\nInternationally, we see LUSH international adopting the knot, a reusable wrap concept attributed to the *Furoshiki*, MUJI now [bringing back Kintsugi pottery repair,](https://medium.com/@jjwalsh/old-style-kintsugi-repair-back-in-fashion-ea2967fa5c1b) and sustainable lifestyle concepts of Satoyama returning in the form of [permaculture](https://youtu.be/DpPZo6u-1h4).\n\n# Sustainable Development Goals for Abroad\n\nThere is a perception that SDG targets should be focused abroad and there are no problems here to fix is common. The confidence that Japan is already balancing the needs of nature and business while taking care of community is a common mindset. \n\nAs someone who cares deeply about Japanese culture, people, and future, I try to link new strategies to Japanese heritage and traditional relevance. The concepts of more frugal, community-centric, nature appreciating olden times that are more relevant than ever in our over-consuming, overly wasteful modern times. \n\n# Inbound Sustainable Travel Demand\n\nAs I am met with questioning looks as to the relevance of even talking about sustainable tourism demand, I am happy to cite recent surveys in the travel industry which indicate an increasing demand for more sustainable travel post-Covid. It has been called a ""watershed moment"", as the 2021 Travel Surveys done by [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) are a great indicator or the sustainability seeking customer demand we will see as travel returns.\n\nStand-out stats from the report show that [83% think sustainability in travel is vital ... 53% get annoyed](https://globalnews.booking.com/bookingcoms-2021-sustainable-travel-report-affirms-potential-watershed-moment-for-industry-and-consumers/) if they are stopped from traveling more sustainably. So making more sustainable strategies for your travel business and communicating it clearly to clients past-present-future is very likely to pay-off. In fact, I am convinced that businesses that preserve the status quo and do nothing are the ones taking a big risk. \n\n# Japanese Companies Creating Sustainable Strategy\n\nThis year, I had a great talk with Eric Kawabata, the [Head of Terracycle/LOOP Japan](https://youtu.be/u6-3YQSfJe4), who is launching the reusable shopping infrastructure service in collaboration with the AEON mall chain across Japan. \n\nI asked if he was getting any resistance from companies he approached, but he said despite expecting resistance, he has been warmly received by manufacturers in Japan. Kawabata-san said that most of the companies he talked to were already in the planning stages of developing a more sustainable, less wasteful, reusable container option for their products. \n\nThat really stuck out to me to hear that big businesses were already planning a transition away from single-use containers. Japan's government targets of reducing the amount of single-use plastic by 2025 may indeed become the new normal.\n\nAll in all, it seems clear that more sustainable strategy in business and tourism is on the horizon in Japan, but we need more discussion of the need for sustainability in our everyday lives. In 2020, the free plastic-bag ban had a positive effect on national targets to reducing plastic waste, and on a personal level, I also saw a huge decrease in the bags at our ocean cleanups. But we need more discussion of sustainability in schools, at all workplaces and in the media. \n\nIt is a risk to any business, entrepreneur or destination to plan merely on compliance with current regulation. I'm excited to see some businesses, entrepreneurs, non-profits and destinations pulling ahead of the curve by talking about sustainable strategy that builds better communities and regenerates the environment now before travel returns."

q18sii,"What should the price of carbon be? So, I’m all for Team Carbon Pricing. I believe the climate crisis is basically a market failure caused by the negative externalities of carbon emissions (climate forcing as well as smog and other health effects) not being appropriately included in the price of coal, oil, etc. If we could make the price of a barrel of oil reflect the true costs, the market would take care of decarbonizing in the most efficient way possible. There are various ways to do this (carbon tax, cap and trade), but they accomplish the same basic task.\n\nI also understand that carbon isn’t priced correctly due to lack of political will. From oil lobbying,  to popular opposition such as the Yellow Vest protests, to lack of international consensus— there are massive barriers to appropriate carbon pricing.\n\nIf we look past the practical issues though, there is another question that I don’t know the answer to. What is the appropriate price for carbon? There must be economists who have looked into this and developed an estimate for what a barrel of oil should cost to account for the current and future environmental impacts. Is anyone on this sub familiar with this research?"

q45mxw,"Why is the climate change issue not treated the same as other social justice movements? Hey, I have been thinking a lot about why many of my ""woke"" friends who are comfortable talking about other civil rights issues and how we all need to work to defend them go silent when how we all need to act to solve the climate crisis is brought up. I wrote a (not essential for this post) blog post about it here:\n\n[https://hahatheworldisending.wordpress.com/2021/10/08/on-rights-and-responsibilities/](https://hahatheworldisending.wordpress.com/2021/10/08/on-rights-and-responsibilities/)\n\nBut I'm also wondering if people have other ideas. Is it good to start bringing in other social justice lingo, like ""privilege"" or so on? Is it because it seems to big and all encompassing? Is it simply because people don't want to act? Or am I being a total jerk for even comparing these things? Any thoughts appreciated!"
q47kph,"Help with college certificate essay Hello I am currently making an outline for an essay about why I want to pursue a sustainability certificate. I’m at a sort of at a crossroads of discussing business environmental impact versus societal footprint. How can I go about discussing both in somewhat nonbiased manner. There is a controversial topic that comes up when discussing an individual's environmental footprint. Mainly that this concept was largely lobbied and sustained by fossil fuel industries like BP. Corporations do alot more harm to the environment than one individual can.  Is there a way I can somehow address this conflict on environmental impact. I have put my outline for reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n•	Intro \no	I have a passion for sustainability\no	I try to pursue a life of frugality and minimalism as best as I can\n•	Thesis \no	The reason why I want to pursue the Sustainable Enterprise program is because I would like adapt my knowledge of sustainability to practically apply it in corporate or small business setting. Environmental issues like climate change and resource exploitation make me worry about the direction we are headed in. Sustainability can lessen the mental and social burden\n•	Body 1\no	I have learned a lot about climate change, green initiatives and figures about the destruction humans are wreaking on the Earth. While this knowledge maybe good for gaining an awareness in environmental issue, it doesn’t give people the solutions to take practical steps to truly start making progress on the threat from climate change. Businesses applying sustainability into their supply chain or operations would be a huge contributing factor in mitigating climate change."

q5mis5,"here’s a bunch of ways ive thought of to be more sustainable, some of these may not apply to you if you’re tight on money or disabled and that’s ok! - shop at second hand stores and yard sales\n\n\n- ask around for things you need rather than getting it brand new\n\n\n- compost food, paper scraps, and all of your compostable waste\n\n\n- avoid online shopping as much as you can\n\n\n- deactivate your amazon prime\nsubscription if you have one\n\n\n- choose a longer shipping option if buying online, this reaps less havoc on the environment\n\n\n- buy unpackaged food from the grocery store rather than plastic packaged\n\n\n- shop from a local farmers market\n\n\n- check ingredient labels for the word “palm” and try to avoid foods that contain it\n\n\n- avoid highly processed foods and opt for whole foods or ingredient lists with only whole foods if able\n\n\n- eat vegetarian or better yet, vegan\n\n\n- make your own plant based milks rather than storebought if able \n\n\n- when buying fruits and veggies, take blemished food that people would not take. this helps to combat food waste, when produce looks bad at grocery stores it gets chucked\n\n\n- *attempt, when able* to avoid supporting kraft, coca-cola, pesico, general mills, kellogs, wrigley, mars, unilever, johnson &amp;amp;amp;amp; johnson, P&amp;amp;amp;amp;G, and nestle. this is difficult as these companies own practically every large brand, but if you have idle time its often very easy to make your own items without supporting these corporations\n\n\n- if you menstruaste use a diva cup if able (also as a commenter added, period panties or reusable pads are options as well)\n\n\n- if you’re lucky there might be a bulk store within 20-30 mins of you, i shop at an incredibly stocked one called “honest weight food co op” in albany NY, they have everything under the sun. bulk molasses, maple syrup, 20 dif kinds of coffee, hemp protein powder, 15 dif kinds of kombucha, 25 different flours, every spice you could imagine, plantable seeds, empty pill capsules, bentonite clay, EVERYTHING\n\n- buy shade grown coffee! typical coffee is now grown in the sun and is a leading cause of different types of pollution, deforestation, massive water usage, and cheap labor done by the global south. shade grown coffee, however, is the traditional way of growing coffee, these “farms” mimic forests and sequester carbon from the atmosphere, and taste so much better! here’s a great video about the disastrous effects typical coffee has: https://youtu.be/Dp8ol4RRRiA (this channel is amazing)\n\n- if decaf is your thing and you like dates, save the seeds from dates, follow a simple recipe for date seed coffee. it tastes just like coffee, just a bit nuttier and sweeter, and has no trace of caffiene like decaf coffee does.\n\n- make food at home more often\n\n- if you’d like to go out to eat, support local establishments rather than chain restaurants\n\n\n- dumpster diving baby. corporate stores that sell anything sometimes throw out hundreds of items a week for various reasons. you can often find food, clothes, and countless other items in these dumpsters, they are often bagged separately from trash and the items themselves are packaged, its not a gross thing like its often portrayed. you can bask in the luxury of enjoying products from large corporations without supporting them in any way, give these things out to people who need them for free, and stop these things from rotting in a landill. many people are able to avoid buying food entirely. for maximum luck keep track of where, what day and what time you were able to score. check out r/dumpsterdiving\n\n\n- grow some crops! no matter where you live, you can grow plants or even build highly efficient garden, indoors or outdoors\n\n\n- plant species that are native to your location to support the environment\n\n\n- if you live on a property with a yard, you can designate your lawn as a certified national wildlife habitat by providing a few things for native species, here’s a link on how: https://bellevuewa.gov/sites/default/files/media/pdf_document/backyard_wildlife_habitat.pdf\n\n\n- when eating out, eat in to avoid plastic takeout containers\n\n\n- bring your own containers when eating out for leftovers, or keep some in your car at all times\n\n\n- make your own products if able, stuff like toothpaste, deoderant, soap, makeup, etc\n\n\n- ecobrick if you have the time! ecobricking is where you cut clean plastic up into pieces about half the size of your finger and shove the pieces in a hard soda bottle (sprite, gatorade bottle, no flimsy water bottles). with the back of a wooden spoon. it gets so dense its similar to a brick, you can drop it off at a location that accepts them or ship them off, these bricks are used to build furniture, houses and schools! or you can use these to build yourself\n\n\n- download Too Good To Go, its a great app where places that sell food can give out food that wouldve gone in a landfill at the end of the day. these surprise bags usually go for $2-$5.\n\n\n- if you are confident enough (or if you work at one of these places), you can go to any place that sells food near you, and ask if they throw out food at the end of the day. if they do you can ask to speak to the manager and tell them about the app Too Good To Go. food stores can list “bags” in any time frame that suits them for a discounted price. so they are still making a profit but simultaneously helping disadvantaged people by giving them fresh food at a heavily discounted price, instead of it going into the trash."

q6a8yo,"""Electric cars will still create CO2 emissions"" is a fallacy I've been discussing this a lot recently. Many people are of the opinion that electric cars still result in emissions, just elsewhere - instead of CO2 coming from the tailpipe of your car, it comes from a fossil fuel power plant.\n\nWhile this is largely true *for now*, it is not necessarily true forever. As we move into the future, there's the possibility that we transition to fully renewable, zero-emission power generation. At that point, electric cars will actually have no correlated CO2 emissions. There are lots of caveats i could get into about this, but for the sake of clarity I wont.\n\nThe argument that electric cars result in comparable emissions to internal combustion engines (ICE) is a fallacy because it relies on the assumption that our power generation infrastructure will stay the same forever. There is no way an ICE will *ever* be zero emissions, but there is a decent chance that in the future, electric cars will be zero emissions.\n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk"

q7bh8n,"Just wanted to give a quick shout out to the Hey Humans line at Target. I’ve been trying out the body wash and deodorant and love them. The deodorant I can actually smell all throughout the day. As someone who seriously struggles finding a good deodorant this one is amazing. Years ago I tried a similar deodorant and I broke out in a rash, I tried the crystal deodorant but wasn’t a fan. The scent I wanted to try wasn’t in stock so I got the banana aloe and it’s nice. \n\nAfter rinsing off the body wash I was shocked that my skin felt soft and actually moisturized compared to the Olay I used to use. I wasn’t a huge fan of any of the scents other than the rose water ginger."

I always tried to be a conscious consumer but I focused more on the ingredients on food packages, eating clean and organic but since I become a parent i started to realise that packaging is also important. I always prefered no plastic but when I needed to use plastic I didn't normally read the ""labels"" of what type of plastic is. Now I am becoming more aware. I found this morning a bio brand whcih its cheese is packaged in tocix plastic ( triangle with number 6 inside). I need to find good reliable sources about toxic plastics around us to avoid them and also, but not least, ingredients in shampoos etc. I have a small baby and I want a better future for him. Is there any good app that help us keep track etc ? any good infomation I appreciate."
q7xaew,"Individuals shifting blame to the companies? To start with; I live as sustainably as I allow myself, I fully support \n\nBut I've noticed that there is the sentiment among green people that it is not the individuals, but the companies that are to blame for all the evil destruction around our planet, after all, they produce and pollute. Individuals sure can withdraw from using straws, but in general, their impact is minuscule. While companies shift the blame to individuals, individuals also shift the blame to companies.\n\nThis is something that I've never fully agreed with, instinctively I felt it off. Aren't companies in today's world merely a response to people's needs and perhaps a reflection of their ideals. \n\nAssuming a free market will do their thing; reducing your needs and changing habits will force the companies to reduce their production and change their products if they still want to stay afloat. If people decide to buy a sustainable product from a sustainably aware and open competitor the evil and polluting company will have to change their ways or lose money. This is a very long-run approach and requires a collective of individuals, social awareness. \n\nObviously, the alternatives are not always there; someone in need of a cheap car would choose any car no matter how green the company producing it is. People with no access or no means to buy sustainable or recyclable products will buy other cheap replacements. \n\nI guess my view is a bit naively hopeful, but I've been wondering what is your view on this and perhaps show me something I don't see."

q81mrg,"On Hot Potatoes *Hey! I like to write things on sustainability that I think other people will find motivating! I won't link directly here because my post gets removed as ""self promotion"". If you want to read more of what I write, I'll put a link in the comments:*\n\nGuys. If there's one thing I know about the climate crisis it's this: it is very serious, someone, somewhere should be doing a lot about it and I am one hundred percent sure that whoever that person is, it isn't me. That's a thought absolutely everyone has! I have it, you probably have it, CEOs have it, politicians have it, absolutely everyone has that thought. The problem with these huge systems we all live in is that there is a diffusion of responsibility. One option is that everyone in the world takes responsibility for their little part and another is that everyone in the world plays a game of responsibility hot potato. No prizes for guessing which one humanity chose! ""Zara, you should take responsibility and pay a living wage across your supply chain"", we say, throwing the potato to them while picking up a pair of slacks. ""Oh, well, we tell our suppliers to behave! They sign a formal agreement!"", says Zara, throwing the potato to the suppliers. ""Well, if Zara paid us enough money we could afford to give people labour rights"" say the suppliers, throwing the potato back to Zara. ""Well, people don't want to pay that much for their clothes"" says Zara, throwing the potato back to the consumer. ""I'm too busy to think about stuff like this"" says the consumer...\n\nMy biggest aim in life is to have a problem solving attitude and sense of agency. There are certain associated advantages and disadvantages to those aims. The advantages are clear! The most important step in solving a problem is to try solutions! So if you try lots of solutions you eventually end up solving a few problems, even if the first solution isn't always the right one. The disadvantages are that sometimes you are terrible when people just need you to shut the fuck up and listen to how they feel rather than saying ""oh well, have you tried x, y and z"", which is a really annoying thing to say if someone just needs to be listened to. Another disadvantage is you get incredibly, incredibly frustrated by the climate crisis because it seems the whole thing is caused by an entire planet of people saying there are zero solutions to this massive problem and when you say ""hey well what about trying this partial solution?"" they say ""oh no, no, that will never work! China is doing very wrong things and also Amazon. Now stop being ridiculous and get out of my way, I have to throw this potato to the government.""\n\nI'm very, very far from doing everything perfectly, but I at least aim to live a life that I think one could reasonably live and, if the big players actually did their job, the earth might be ok. In the imaginary world I created in my head, using a great deal of imagination, the governments have done all they can to install systems that reduce carbon emissions and in return the proletariat have changed their lifestyle to eliminate those emissions which the governments could not eliminate by installing existing technologies and regulating private business. Such a life involves eating mostly plants, so that’s what I do. There is nothing on the horizon that can possibly take care of our humongous meat problem. Such a life involves taking my own containers and produce bags to the grocer and deli and buying unpackaged food, so I do that as well. There is no other solution to that problem, because plastic recycling is a lie and unfettered paper consumption being sustainable is another lie. So I bring my own bags, no big deal. I also try to not buy items and if I really, really want something, I try to buy it second hand, because probably there is nothing the system can do to make the enormous amount of things we buy sustainable. So I buy as few new physical things as I can, no problemo. Such a life involves flying as little as possible so I take the train when I can, guiltily carbon offset when I can't and try to envision and work towards a life in which I don't need to fly. On the other hand, there is also a huge “system” going on, which I cannot fix and the only thing I can do about that is complain a lot to people who can do stuff about it and try to make sure my euros don’t feed it. So that’s what I do.\n\nThe thing that I want emphasise about this lifestyle is that the effort is largely front-loaded. It's like quitting cigarettes. You put in a big amount of effort for a couple of weeks or months and then it's just about not getting knocked off course. I spend a lot of my time thinking about the best way to convince people to just try, actually, because once people get over the mental hurdles of ""but I don't *want* to have to remember my keepcup"" or ""I don't *want* to adjust what I eat"" or ""I don't *want* to have to think about how much I drive"" they'll usually discover it's not so hard! I got on and off the horse for years, vegan for six months here, only buying second hand items for a year there and so on. I can say with confidence that the absolute hardest step is getting past your mind's defense system. It takes a huge effort to get over the thoughts of ""oh why should I have to do things when the developing countries are doing this and that and the government isn't doing such and such and Jeff Bezos exists and..."" But once you do it the first time it's like riding a bike! Sure maybe you fall off, but getting back on is not half as difficult as it was the first time.\n\nJust because we take responsibility for our tiny bit doesn't mean that the big players will magically start taking responsibility for their huge bit. But the thing about hot potato is that if someone, anyone, just works up the courage to hold on to that potato then *the game is over*! If consumers say ""hey Inditex, we're not going to buy your shit anymore unless you get your act together"" then the game of hot potato is over and Inditex either stops this ridiculous greenwashing and actually gets its act together or Inditex goes bankrupt. Similarily, if people just stop eating so much meat and start eating beans instead of asking why the government keeps subsidising beef then *that* game of hot potato is over! The government will have to say ""god it appears that a big section of the population is no longer burger obsessed, maybe we can roll back the subsidies a bit and try for some points with these crazy tofu eaters?"" So just ask everyone you know to hold the potato! Ask your friends, ask your local supermarkets, ask your family, ask the EU, ask your local politicians, everyone! Shout at every single person or body you have access to ""please, the world is ending and we don't have time for this game anymore. Please just hang onto the potato!"" And 95% of the time the answer will be more or less ""fuck off"" and that's ok! Because 5% of the time people say ""by Jove, you're right! Shit, let's go. Hey everyone HANG ON TO YOUR POTATO!"" Did I take this metaphor too far? I think I pushed this one a bit. Anyway, hopefully the meaning is clear."

q89ydl,"Sustainable Savings Account Hi folks,\n\nI've been working through my checklist of life changes to promote sustainability. Pretty proud of how far I've come over the last few years.\n\nAny way, one of the last things to do is transfer my savings account over to a sustainably focused bank. I really enjoy the customer service and usability of chase (and have also been a Wells Fargo customer for years), but I'm sick of keeping my money with an institution that I know is funding investments that are anti-sustainability.\n\nI've done some research, and kind of disappointed in what I've been able to find. If anyone has experience with these banks and can provide feedback (or other suggestions) I'd really appreciate it! I want my savings to work just like I am. I am NOT concerned about interest rates, transaction maximums, etc. I just want somewhere I can trust (both to use my money sustainably and that I won't be defrauded), has a good UI, and customer service I can speak with.  \n\n\n* Aspiration - one of the first banks to focus on sustainability, as far as I know. They have a lot of great features and 22K reviews on Apple app store, but many of the reviews are so sad to hear and other searches online make me very cautious (basically, they freeze your account and there is no customer service to speak with)\n* Atmos - Online they claim to invest only in sustainable investments. Overall seems good, but new company and very few reviews online\n* Ando - same as Atmos. But, it does appear Alex Honnold vouches for them. I know.... not that big a deal but I love Honnold and trust him\n* Bank of the West - claim to be sustainable and diverse. Large bank with history so I feel like I can trust them with my money. But, I've seen some concerning reviews about fraud and I'm not sure how much I can trust a big bank to be sustainable. I'm leaning towards West because of their history and size."

I have read (sorry for not quoting but I swear I’m quoting data from serious studies, not some random conspiracy theories site) that is literally impossible to predict how the rise on the levels of the oceans will affect us. It can provide us worst earthquakes, with more frequency, due the crashes between tectonic plates, it can create worst hurricanes due changes in the temperatures and the levels of humidity in the air, etc. So, if we know we don’t know how the future is going to look like in terms of safety, why is nuclear energy still an option. How can nuclear engineers can swear the new nuclear facilities are incredible safe, safe for what, the environment as we already know it? But is going to change, soon, in unpredictable ways, so how can you make something safe for the unknown?

So, if up to 1.3 billion tones of food are wasted per year… is really going to hurt us if we produce less? I understand the economics behind it, like if less food is produced the prices will go higher, offer and demand, but what about the policies that are demanding to food producers and sellers to not waste it… a policy which eventually will mean produce less food, in a more conscious way. Like; should we worry (we as in we middle class to upper class countries, sad that in poor countries even now people die of hunger) or is a real threat?"

Hi guys,\n\nFirstly, just wanted to preface this is not my position, I am asking this from the perspective of those who believe otherwise. Let me explain:\n\nSome people think we can save the planet by going ‘net zero’ meaning instead of actually ending the fossil industry, we instead have machines that suck the carbon out of the air and sell it back to people as fuel. Thus, when scaled up, we will end up having net zero i.e. a scenario where fossil fuel can exist so long as the carbon it emits is captured by these machines and we essentially create a ‘sustainable’ loop whereby no extra carbon is emitted.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nI have serious doubts about it personally.\n\nThanks in advance."

qh6uzc,"One of my pet peeves about sustainable fashion-my opinion I only purchase cotton clothing and actually cannot tolerate wearing other materials like polyester for example. I've been like this for well over a decade already. I do find cotton clothing in mainstream stores and often find organic cotton in stores like Jcrew. My golden rule for clothing is that I never pay more than $25 per article like a skirt, pants, dress and under $15 for tops, tees etc. I find great stuff on sale or clearance racks, and only buy stuff that I know I'll get a lot of use of for a long time. I like to think that I'm succeeding at being sustainable when it comes to fashion.\n\nHowever, I recently came across a brand on social media which seemed to have a great cause behind it including them advocating for sustainability. Their items were 100% cotton and looked very fashionable. The problem for me: the price of their items was over $250.  \n\nNow, it's obviously a personal choice on how much people choose to spend on clothing.  But shouldn't sustainable fashion be affordable as well? If we're so passionate about sustainability, shouldn't we want it accessible for all, not only the rich who are willing or able to spend that much on clothing? It just felt very hypocritical to me. Just curious to hear y'all's thoughts on this topic."

qjexey,"Trying to convince my boss to start thinking about sustainability and I need your help: Which companies do it right? Hi all, I work for a small-ish (100 employees) company that makes hardware that is used in the development process in the embedded electronics industry, mainly in the automotive industry. I'm trying to push efforts for our company to become more sustainable and environmentally and socially responsible, and while my boss is not entirely unsympathetic to the cause, he is taking a tough negotiating stance and will not agree to anything unless I can show that at least some other companies (preferably in our industry) are adopting similar measures to what I'm proposing. I also pointed out to him that we do already tick some of the sustainability boxes, like having in-house manufacturing instead of outsourcing it, sourcing local components, and minimizing plastics in our products, and I feel like we should communicate this  clearly to our customers, both in terms of what we already do right, and what we are committed to improve. His response was again that I have to show him how other companies communicate this, to give us an idea of what that entails.\n\nSo, what I ask from you is any info and resources on these two topics:\n\n* Examples of companies (preferably in the automotive or tech industry) that ""do it right"", that are either already very sustainable or environmentally friendly, or have adopted very thorough plans on how to get there\n   * I  can find tons of examples like [Fairphone](https://www.fairphone.com/en/) where the company is built on the foundation of sustainability, and while that's probably still a useful reference (it shows that ""sustainable"" does not negate ""economically viable""), I'm more interested in ""regular"" companies that changed course or adopted significant measures, since that's most applicable to us at this point\n* Examples of sustainability PR and marketing material (webpages, flyers, videos) from companies that ""tick all the boxes"" in your opinion. By which I mean companies that make it clear what their goals and priorities are, don't try to greenwash without any concrete commitments, and ideally do this in a very straightforward way\n   * I found [Tesla's report](https://www.tesla.com/ns_videos/2020-tesla-impact-report.pdf) quite good in terms of content and showing actual data, but it is loooong and unwieldy, and they don't provide any short summary or anything. I also like [Infineon's webpage](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/about-infineon/sustainability/) (we do a lot of business with them), though you do have to click through lots of subpages, but it's concise, straight-to-the-point, and backs their claims by actual certificates from third-party evaluation bodies. However, we can't afford the overhead of an independent certification at this point, so Infineon's approach also isn't entirely applicable for our company at this point in time.\n\nGreenwashing and bogus empty language is also something we'll have to be careful with, so if you know of any particularly bad examples, those would be much appreciated as well.\n\nThank you so much in advance for any responses, I think this is a good opportunity for me to do my part in making the world a more sustainable place to live and work, and I'm trying to do the best job I can to convince management that we should do something about it. So having your help might be the drop over the edge that I need to make some actual change happen in our company."

So I've been reading about climate anxiety, about the ways we can handle that by being active and talking about our feelings of frustration and fear with others who feel the same, etc. But a thing that really gets on my nerves, are people who claim ""It doesn't matter what you do, you can't fight big corporations, they are the only ones to blame, we are all doomed"". First, is frustrating because no; even tho corporations suck, we still have power as consumers to demand them to go better, and to choose safer options (at least you can do it in middle class- rich countries, and let's just focus on the people who can act). And second, is such a big fat lie. I become vegetarian in 2006 and all i heard was how useless that choice was. I was only 14, and it was really exhausting to hear that always, but time showed how quitting meat could actually make a difference, and we can see it now with the rising on veganism and animal advocacy.

We also use water clean water in our houses for cooking, washing our hands, showers and drinking. Not everyone in the world is fortunate enough to have clean water to use. Electricity is used in houses and buildings, which uses up coal, oil, natural gas and more.

Imagine a food truck, but instead, it provides you with refill services for common household products such as laundry detergent, dish soap, shampoo, cleaning solutions, etc. Other dry goods such as rice, beans, pasta, could also be provided. \n\nThe truck would go around neighbourhoods on a weekly scheduled basis and customers could come up to the truck with their containers, and refill it with whatever products they may need. This reduces the inconvenience of hauling out different containers to a bulk store and transporting it all the way back home. \n\nIt is our hope that this prototype could be a viable solution in helping communities reduce unnecessary plastic waste. \n\nWe understand that some may have questions or concerns. Please feel free to comment down below or ask your questions in the survey. \n\nResponse will be anonymous. \n\nThank you for your kind participation 🤗\n\nLink 👉🏼 [https://forms.gle/DNCe4qR9CfHZvQHJ8](https://forms.gle/DNCe4qR9CfHZvQHJ8)"

qn3vxl,"Sustainable Natural Latex Global warming is real and for many of us who cares about earth for our next generation is always looking for eco-friendly alternatives. From the food we consume, to the vehicle we drive and even to the beds we sleep in. If you're a greenie looking looking for new beds, you must consider latex. Natural latex mattress has gained popularity as the green alternative to Memory Foam but many are still unsure by how much. This article looks into the life cycle of Natural Latex Foam, it will help you make an educated choice when selecting your bed.\n\nA natural latex mattress starts its journey from Hevea Brasiliensis, the rubber tree. This species produce the most latex a year but it needs 6 years to mature before harvesting. When harvesting begins, farmers could only collect 100g of natural latex from a tree every 2 days. This means it takes 12 acres of harvest to make a queen size mattress. More latex mattresses means more trees.\n\nUnlike logging, rubber trees are not harmed when tapped for latex. It only takes a shallow 6mm cut on the tree bark for latex to flow and latex can be collected for hours. Furthermore, rubber tappers will rotate the locations they tap, allowing the trees to heal, an art the farmers perfected through many generations of farming and harvesting. Truly sustainable. \n\nBesides not harming the trees, 12 acres of green can help to remove 143 tons of carbon dioxide every year. So buying natural latex would actually have a positive impact to our environment because acres and acres of rubber trees will be planted for farmers to meet our demands. Making natural latex truly green, sustainable and renewable.\n\nRubber latex products has been around for 100 years now and it's a real gift from nature. But because harvesting is slow, its price is higher compared to fossil fuel petrochemical foams like Memory or PU Foams. Its CO2 vs $, which price would you pay?\n\nInterested to compare Latex vs Memory Foam? Read this [article](https://www.liliamber.com.au/blogs/know-your-mattress/why-latex).

Just because those days the buyer wanted a product which is robust, lasts as long as possible and is repairable.\n\nToday the focus is on cheap products - in short term. Let's get the example of a toaster I saw which was sold in the 1960s. The job it did was the same as a toaster today - zoasting the bread. Not better or worse than a toaster today.

One thing I do remember from my time working at a Kroger myself is that one of the deductions from my paycheck was “Union Dues,” which led me to believe Kroger was part of a worker’s union and/or was a local business (due to being family-owned).\n* For those that aren’t vegan (not that I’m that concerned), how do you get non-vegan products in more sustainable ways? Do you get them from a local farmer’s market?\n* What are some general tips you can give for more sustainable living? I try not to purchase animal products intentionally.\n* Does this count as a leftist subreddit? Part of this sub’s MO is taking a stand against mass environmental damage at the hands of capitalism, leading me to believe it’s a leftist group. On the other hand, what may prevent a right-wing person from participating in discussions on this sub? Can they still be part of the sustainability movement?\n* How do you try to live sustainably, yet affordably (on a roughly $20k to $50k salary)?\n* If I still have meat in a family’s house that no one is eating, yet I never paid for, should I eat it over throwing it away? Should I simply give it to some other people, preferably poor/hungry people?\n\nThanks for taking the time to read over and answering my questions.

Chevron then used every trick in the book to frame the situation as Donziger being the corrupt one, and Chevron having done nothing wrong. This includes bribing judges, fabricating evidence against Donziger, etc. \n\nIt is super clear that Chevron is the one who is in the wrong, yet people in the law subreddit (read the comments on the thread I linked), many of whom I assume do work in law or are aspiring to enter the field, are saying that Donziger is wrong because he refused to give up his electronic devices to be searched, and that Donziger violated terms and conditions that a lawyer shouldn't, etc. However, that's like saying me saving a person from dying (analogy for defending a country from oil pollution) is illegal, because I crossed the street illegally to save the person (analogy for Donziger not complying with how a lawyer should behave). \n\nDonziger is an example of an ethical lawyer but almost every other lawyer seems to hate him. This proves that most lawyers like to play devil's advocate for oil companies, which is exactly why oil companies almost never face legal action. Bribing by the oil companies is a big part of it, but I'm sure the law subreddit commenters are not paid by any company, meaning that even without bribes, lawyers tend to be biased towards big oil. I'm not saying every single lawyer except for Donziger is unethical, I'm saying that in general, they care too much about technicalities (focusing on what Donziger did wrong as a lawyer) rather than the big picture (the fact the Donziger is fighting an important cause). \n\nI clicked on the profile of one of those who commented in that thread.

I recently placed an order with Grove Co. and I really like the things I ordered, I stuck with their brand on things avoiding mrs Meyers/plastic packaging etc. \n\nNow here is where my dilemma begins, I have been looking into better alternatives to my current detergent and dishwasher pods and I’m almost done using both of them up, I was interested in ordering Dropps brand and have heard lots of great reviews but I saw on grove that their brand has an similar product, the reviews on their website were good but I’m wondering if they genuinely are good at stain removal, I have three kids so I need stain fighting POWER (which is why I still serve the devil aka tide) would love some insight because I know dropps and grove have offfset their shipping but I don’t want to have multiple subscriptions if I can help it."

r0ewvj,"CULT Food Science (CSE: CULT) Leads Seed Investment Round for Celebrity Brendan Brazier’s Fiction Foods Happy Tuesday ladies and gents.  For those that haven’t yet heard the news, Cult Food Science has emerged as the sole strategic investor in Fiction Food LLC’s seed round.  So what's the big deal? Fiction Foods is another disruptive player entering the foodtech space.  In a nutshell, it leverages emerging technology to help construct a transparent, intelligently designed, nutritionally-superior and smarter food system at a lower environmental cost than what is currently available. Built upon a data-driven approach to product construction, Fiction Foods has the goal of obtaining more nutrients (proteins, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, phytochemicals) while consuming less of each natural resource (land, water, fossil fuel). They call this the Nutrient to-Resource Ratio, and it is their “north star”. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe founder of this amazing company is none other than Brendan Brazier. Co-developer of Beyond Meat’s (BYND) “Beast Burger”, and co-founder of Vega (VEGA). BYND is currently valued at $5B, and Vega was acquired in 2015 by WhiteWave Foods Company for US$550 million, representing one of the most successful cash exits in the nascent years of the plant-based industry.  So in other words, Mr. Brazier has a proven track record of success for getting disruptive alt-food companies off the ground.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs we’ve seen over the past month, Cult Food Science has been strategically investing in a number of cellular agriculture companies such as Melibeo (bee-free honey), which was recently named as one of TIME magazine's top 100 inventions of the year, and not to forget as well as investing in 3D bio-tech. Dovetailing nicely with this larger trend, Fiction Food’s corporate concept and strategy is a perfect fit with high growth-potential for CULT’s expanding portfolio of investee companies in the cellular agriculture space.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConsidering Brenda Brazier's astronomical success with previous (similar) ventures, my assessment is that Fiction Foods clearly has serious potential to make a name for itself in this burgeoning field. For impact/food-tech investors interested in global food security and alternatives to the factory food/meat industry, CULT’s recent strategic investment into Fiction Foods is precisely the type of bullish indicator one would hope to see before the former’s imminent IPO.  Keep an eye out, DYOR, and this should not be construed as financial advice.  Trade responsibly folks!"

Every year, billions of sardines move north along this unspoiled coastline, attracting and sustaining sharks, dolphins, sailfish, whales and other marine life. Now, in the wake of the COP26 climate conference where leaders agreed on the urgent need for action, a seismic survey of the area is about to begin in hopes of finding new oil and gas deposits under the seafloor.

r122r6,"Stupid question inbound, but I was talking with a friend about a sustainability course we both took and it made me realise I have no idea why it's becoming more important to reduce water consumption. Is it because of growing population? Or water climate means lower water reserves? I know in places like California and South Africa they had issues with too little water and needed to do rationing, but those places were already quite warm, so is the issue becoming more relevant because climate change is, overall, reducing rain fall?\n\nBut then the need also applies to places like the Netherlands where it rains almost every week. Water conservation is still relevant there. but why are the methods that have been in plae the past few decades not holding up any more?"

And this is tied to the big lie that Columbus somehow made it to America first (which he didn't) and 'discovered' the US which happened to have thousands living well, happily and sustainably.  And the so-called hero cowboys that were basically dumb-ass rednecks (likely modern day Trumpers) killed every Native American that they could find that did not conform to European traditions.  And lastly, we killed countless numbers of buffalo which had sustained the native residents for hundreds of years before being discovered.  And in true American style we gloss over these hard truths and instead rationalize this Holiday as giving thanks to those we care about.  And of course, to add insult to injury, the day after Thanksgiving is the busiest shopping day of the year.  So we might think of Thanksgiving as the Anti-Earth Day or Unsustainable Thursday.  Wow - I just went off on a big tangent!  Happy Thanksgiving  (sorry)...gulp"

They also use some of the most advanced technology in the industry that allows for our dying process to use 1/10th of the dye that the process traditionally entails.

kecs1s,"Should I build a motivation App to be Better? Hey Guys and Gals, I have been trying to live a sustainable, zero-waste life for the past few years. But I am always feeling like whatever I am doing is not enough. Like all my efforts are meaningless in this world of 8 billion. \n\nIt is a crushing feeling.\n\nSo I am thinking of building an app, like a daily diary of actions. Where we can log any action we take throughout the day towards zero-waste or sustainability. It can be a small thing like ""repurposing a jar"" or something more significant such as ""setting up a website to repurpose work related waste""\n\nAfterwards these actions can be rated by the community - not some algorithm, not me, not a webmaster, but rather **the community** will rate this action on a scale of 1-10. \n\nThis will serve 2 purposes\n\n1. It will motivate and encourage the user to do more\n2. It will give others new ideas on sustainability \n\nSo what do you guys think?\n\nI only want to build it, if you guys will use it. No point in building something if its not helpful.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, suggestions, your own challenges on this journey towards zero-waste and sustainable lifestyle."

kg1p55,"Why is equilibrium climate sensitivity dependent on the initial CO2 levels? Equilibrium climate sensitivity is the higher long-term increase in global average temperature expected to occur after the effects of a doubled CO\n2 concentration have had time to reach a steady-state. Estimates put this metric to be somewhere from 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius for Earth currently.\n\nI was looking at the CCM3 and Chou models [here] (http://forecast.uchicago.edu/Projects/full_spectrum.html)\nand it looks like, all conditions kept the same, the change from increasing CO2 from 100 to 200ppm is smaller than 200 to 400ppm, which is smaller than the change from 400 to 800ppm, and so on. \n\nIs this just because there is some sort of underlying linear or increasing relationship between CO2 concentrations and temperature, so since each subsequent doubling has a larger raw difference (100-&gt;200 is 100ppm difference, but 600 -&gt;1200ppm is 600ppm difference, and the 600-&gt;1200 leads to a larger temperature change)? What could be the actual reason?\n\nIf this is the case, then how can we define an equilibrium climate sensitivity? There is no fixed change for a doubling of CO2, it seems to depend on the initial CO2 levels (as of course, that deems how much you are going to increase the CO2 levels by in a doubling). There would seemingly need to be a qualification on what level that doubling is occurring at."
kg2et8,"Food Waste Solution Help For a tl;dr, look at the bolded text.\n\nHi there! A few months ago, I pitched a plan for a campus-wide (and hopefully local residents too) food waste initiative. I won't go into details because there was a lot that went into it, but basically last month they gave me a huge grant to get it started and a job at the sustainability office. I have been tirelessly trying to get everything together and it's been exhausting (but worth it).\n\n**Anyway,** here's the irony of this post:\n\nI never leave things to the last minute, but I've been so busy with the food waste project that I haven't been managing my finals schedule well. For my sustainable agriculture class, I am writing a relatively long research essay on **fighting food waste in America** and I'm supposed to describe the situation for half the essay and then spend the other half talking about **an existing method of preventing waste from occurring and about an existing method of recycling the waste**. I'm not talking about at a household level; **it has to be something larger scale (retailers/gov't/etc)**.\n\nI originally was going to do the first half about **standardized date labeling and the second about centralized composting** but I ran into an issue. I wrote the composting half, but **I cannot figure out how in the world to write 5-6 pages about standardized date labeling, and can't find an alternative that seems any more doable. Does anyone have any suggestions (or more info about date labeling)?**\n\nIt can't be about consumer education."

kj69au,"Q&amp;A with sustainable investing platform co-founder, Zach Stein from Carbon Collective. He helped outline climate investing that's eco-friendly AND profitable. Hey all - I've seen a lot of posts on here about sustainable investing ideas and tools. I struggle with prioritizing sustainable investing because I don't want to lose money, but then I learned about Carbon Collective (I'm not affiliated; just interviewed their founder since I write free bite-sized climate action plans and get a LOT of q's about sustainable investing).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here's the link](https://www.soapboxproject.org/journal/what-is-sustainable-investing-and-is-it-profitable) to the Q&amp;A (\~4 min read). Personally I think the 3 questions below were the most impactful for me so I just included them below. Curious to know your thoughts!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What do you define as sustainable or ethical investing?**\n\n**‍**  \n**‍**We focus on sustainable investing because broad ethical investing is really hard. Why? We live in a deeply unequal, overly exploitative society. ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) investing has been the financial world's best attempt at creating a way to invest ethically. And it's not great. Basically, analysts from different firms assign scores to publicly traded companies on these three categories. They then average them together to give each company a meta score. With these scores, they'll build a portfolio of companies above a certain threshold. The problem - these scores are totally subjective. The analysis firms don't agree with each other. And they combine all metrics together, meaning some really bad companies still make the cut, including many fossil fuel companies. So to us, ESG = less bad, but not good.\n\n  \nWe took a simpler, far more understandable approach, focusing on a single metric: carbon footprint. The carbon footprint data for publicly traded companies is quite strong. We love this free tool: [**https://fossilfreefunds.org/**](https://fossilfreefunds.org/). We use carbon footprint plus a few other tweaks to build portfolios that we believe are as sustainable as you can get while preserving diversity and low fees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Many people see sustainability as a trade-off with wealth building. What do you say to that?**\n\n**‍**  \n**‍**The tradeoff is a myth at this point. From 2010 - 2019, [**renewable energy stocks have soundly outperformed fossil fuel stocks**](https://blog.carboncollective.co/top-renewable-energy-stocks-beat-fossil-fuels/) in the US, UK, France, and Germany. Since the Covid-19 stock market crash back in March, 2020, the difference has been even more extreme. From 01/01/20 - 10/01/20, the energy sector returned: -49.45%. The clean energy sector: 82.60%. Historical returns are no guarantee of future ones, but a strategy divesting from fossil fuel and reinvesting in companies solving climate change would have performed well looking back over the past 5 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf we look even further back, say to 1927, a [**portfolio divested from fossil fuels still would have performed about the same as the S&amp;P 500**](https://blog.carboncollective.co/divestment-historical-performance/). Since then, the S&amp;P 500 delivered an average return of 11.53% annually. The S&amp;P 500 with fossil fuels removed would have returned 11.48%  per year.\n\n‍\n\n \n\n**There are so many companies that claim to provide sustainable investments — why should we trust yours?**\n\n‍\n\nTransparency. One of our greatest personal frustrations with the sustainable/ethical investing space is that so many companies end up saying some equivalent of ""this is great, just trust us."" How they make decisions to include and exclude is really unclear. That's hard from an ethical perspective, but also a financial one. How do I know what criteria you'll be using to make these decisions in the future? Greenwashing is super real and it's unfortunately common in the sustainable investment space. You can find exactly what's in our portfolios and the logic behind our decision-making on our [**website**](http://www.carboncollective.co/).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe believe that investing with the total stock market in low-fee index funds is the smartest way for average investors like you and me to invest over the long term. So we wanted to build a way to invest like that but for the world as if it had already transitioned off of fossil fuels. And we believe we've built the best way for doing that."

kjaiim,"EcoFighter - A Sustainability App Hey everyone!\n\nI'm currently developing an app that is both fun and sustainable. The idea I have is to build a game where the currency is earned through green habits. Things like reusing water bottles or reusable bags will add coins to your account which can be used within the game. The goal is essentially to encourage people to change their habits. Tracking habits will take seconds (simply just a +) and you will get the chance to visualize your impact. I had this cool idea to have some sort of way where you can see your trickle effect where if you invite anyone, and those you invite essentially invite someone, you can see that trickling impact you had from inviting them. Kind of a cool way to get people involved, but that's something for me to ponder more.  \n\nI got this idea about 6 months ago when I was in a sustainability app contest, but sadly it got canceled, but the idea lived on. I know there are a few apps that do something similar, but I think I will be able to do it better through UI &amp; UX improvements, but also really focusing on community and social elements. Sweatcoins and Ingress are both apps where I am drawing some inspiration from. Ultimately, I really want to make something that can help keep our Earth clean and make it fun.\n\nThe app is currently in development, but I do have a landing page if you would be interested in joining the Waitlist.

Last year, at my husband’s insistence, we supplied these to our guests to celebrate the new year, but I felt awful about the impact of them - not to mention that our guests generally left all of their trash on the ground afterwards, leaving us to clean it up the next day. \n\nI know that he’s going to make the same arguments this year about having fun and whatever, but he doesn’t value everyday sustainability as much as I do - does anyone have any ideas or things that they’ve used in the past to combat the use of sparklers and party poppers that I can use in a counter argument? \n\nThanks in advance!"

kmnjhj,"Bulldog Razors - Greenwash scam? Hi all, \n\nThis is a bit of a random one but since I considered it, the issue has been niggling away at me for a while now... So, lately I've been attempting to find some sustainable alternatives to the typical things we use on a daily basis. Shaving is a bit of a tricky one as there are good alternatives to the cartridge standard (the gillette mach 3's &amp; venus razors of the world, for instance) but not everyone trusts themselves with a safety razor, and an electric razor isn't what everyone will switch to, especially for shaving more intimate regions of the body. \n\nAt first I was happy to find out that bulldog offered a sustainable cartridge razor and figured, great, problem solved! But later on and after having a closer read of the product description, I realised that they never actually talk about the heads of the razors in their descriptions. They mention how the handle is produced from glass or bamboo, and the packaging is paper, all of which is produced from recycled sources BUT the one thing they never mention are the heads, or the trays they come in for that matter. The heads seem to be the exact same as any other standard razor (a mix of plastic and metal), and the case they come is hard plastic too. \n\nNow some of you might think I'm overreacting or digging too much into the details here, but the biggest problem about all these cartridge type razors things (by the way sorry if there's a better term that I'm not using for these things) are the bloody heads! They're the things that cant be recycled because they're mixed materials, so they usually end up in landfill or incinerated. If they are the same as any standard razor, then what I see is an easy sell from a company who decides to just create a bamboo or glass handle from recycled stuff (relatively easy) and package the outside in recycled cardboard (also easy) - and then sells a razor at huge scale to people who think that the problem is now solved, and at a good price in comparison to its competitors. \n\nFair enough, it's good that the packaging etc is from recycled/sustainable sources, but I think its a bit misleading when the biggest problem is the actual razor head that people have to dispose of on a regular basis... (and not the handle which people usually hold on to for a good while) I don't know, I just think this is a pretty brilliant greenwashing scam if they haven't done anything to better the disposal of the razor head situation. And what's more, and not that I'm against companies trying out a new sustainable 'sub-company/brand', bulldog is owned by a huge company that owns a bunch of other personal care companies such as the very prominent shaving brand Wilkinson Sword. Here's the link so you see what I'm talking about - \n\n[https://edgewell.com/brands/](https://edgewell.com/brands/)\n\nNow from a business perspective, using the same or very similar razor heads to the ones being produced for the other shaving companies (using probably the same machines) could be a very lucrative operation, with the massive upside of snapping up a whole bunch of new clientele from a different demographic (ones that are actively trying to live more sustainably). That's a pretty decent business model if I do say so myself! Unfortunately also misleading, and at the cost of the environment. \n\nArguably, they are still probably better than other razors companies of the same type, as they are making some kind of effort on the sustainability front, but this is a pretty damn misleading marketing concept/tactic if the razor heads aren't actually sustainable right?? Bulldog will by no means make any type of a dent in our pollution problem if the main issue is the razor head can't be recycled  - I question if we are a bit too trusting to think that only these guys and NO OTHER company have managed to figure out how to make a sustainable razor-head?  If it was that easy and cheap, then would all the other shaving companies not be jumping on the bandwagon too? There's a serious amount of money to made if it were the case, not to mention helping the companies to become more sustainable in the process - also something that would boost profits and shareholder value in the businesses. \n\nOkay I'm done, sorry for being over the top for some of you here. It's just annoying to sense a scam taking place right in front of our eyes and there's not even a mention of it on the internet anywhere... No ones on the case, there's no critique, no bad ratings etc., nothing to give consumers a heads up that this is a misleading product. \n\nI'd love to see companies that greenwash be brought to justice in some way. They are indeed worse than the standard products because at least they're not lying to us, and what's more (and probably more important actually), they're holding back people from making truly sustainable choices that have a positive impact in the world. Plastic razors are in the top ten most polluting products of the world, we really do not need extra hurdles thrown in our way when trying to figure out how to tackle these problems. (This of course goes for all major polluting industries and products)\n\nIf any of you have comments, I'd be grateful to hear them. Can they get away with this kind of thing? Should they provide more clarity in their descriptions? If you can confirm that I'm being totally OTT on this, or that I'm completely wrong, then please do - it would be less of a pain in the ass and better for the planet  (!)\n\nThanks :)"
kmtl7p,"Not sure if I should get a new mattress I have been struggling with back pain for years and have been sleeping on poor mattresses.

We know we can change our diets, fly less, drive electric cars, and turn off the lights. **So why is it so hard to figure out what to do?**\n\n‍\n\nI believe the steps must be a little more organized and build towards *structural* change. There's too many ""options"" and information overwhelm, and it's hard to know where to start. \n\n‍\n\n**Here's a five-step plan to fight climate change in a way that works for you** (hopefully! Lmk)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to share this five-step plan, [here's a link.](https://www.soapboxproject.org/journal/where-to-start-fighting-climate-change-a-5-step-plan)\n\n### STEP 1: Get clear on your values and objectives\n\n‍\n\nYes, you're interested in stopping the extinction of humanity, but what drives you on a personal level? Are you interested in saving money? Being the smartest person in the room? Making new friends? Finding a job that actually makes a difference? If you can align your sustainability journey with things you *already* care about, you're much more likely to stick with it.\n\n‍\n\nYou might already know what you care about, but if not, here's a [**values exercise**](https://www.cmu.edu/career/documents/my-career-path-activities/values-exercise.pdf) you can explore.\n\n‍\n\nI'm motivated by convenience, money savings, and trying new things. If you're wondering what on earth that has to do with my fight against climate change, keep reading!\n\n‍\n\n### STEP 2: Identify some high-leverage solutions you're interested in\n\n‍\n\nBy this, I mean — there's *thousands* of ways you can be more sustainable. However, each action does not carry equal weight.\n\n‍\n\nFor example, although you still should turn off your lights and unplug your electronics, if you're motivated by how to make the most effective change when it comes to the environment, consider getting involved in climate action, powering your home with renewable energy, being vegan, and not wasting food.\n\n‍\n\nProject Drawdown created two scenarios that map out the biggest reductions in CO2, which you can [**check out here.**](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions)\n\n‍\n\nThat table can still be a little overwhelming if you're just getting started in determining your role in this fight. Here's where I'd start:\n\n‍\n\nA climate expert told me that the **three biggest ways we can fight climate change are through food, energy, and transportation.** That sounds pretty obvious, but if you're looking for a high-leverage solution, I'd start by picking one of those buckets.\n\n‍\n\nI care most about my food-related impact. For me, food is about more than climate change - it's about environmental justice, poverty reduction, food security, and so much more. I love food, so it made the most sense, and food waste is #1 on the Drawdown list.\n\n‍\n\nAlso, remember my motivators above? Here's how it ties back:\n\n* **Convenience:** I don't eat meat, so things are significantly easier to cook. I don't have to worry about getting salmonella or ethically sourcing meat. Also, since I don't waste food, I don't have to cook as much, opting instead for leftovers. Woohoo!  \n‍\n* **Money savings:** being vegetarian and eliminating my household food waste means that our meals cost less and last longer. When I learned last year about how much household food waste contributes to climate change, I started paying more attention. Instead of throwing away old rice and bread butts, I repurposed and got creative via fried rice and homemade bread crumbs.  \n‍\n* **Trying new things:** the whole #NoFoodWaste journey has shown me hundreds of new recipes to try. I also learned about how grocery stores promote overproduction, so I've started buying produce at the farmer's market. I've explored San Francisco and Seattle partially through farmers' markets alone and it's been great. It's even helped me feel like I have plans during COVID!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n### STEP 3: Understand your circle of influence\n\n‍\n\nOur identities are multi-dimensional, so why not use that to our advantage? I identify as a South Asian woman entrepreneur. I have wonderful friends and a supportive family network.\n\n‍\n\nHere's some examples to show how I think about my identity and my influence:  \n‍\n\n* **Family** — how can I have direct conversations with receptive family members on swapping out ziplocs for Tupperware?  \n‍\n* **Friends** — what donation links can I share with my friends so they get corporate matches? I also share higher-effort structural actions with them because I know they care enough to take action  \n‍\n* **Fellow entrepreneurs** — can I give them tips for sustainable packaging that could save them $ and/or put a positive spin on their brand? Can I get intros to their corporate funders and ask them about their sustainability efforts?  \n‍\n* **South Asian community** — How can I raise awareness about food waste and get folks to donate food after 100+ person weddings instead of throwing it away? Which clothing rental companies can I promote as a fancy alternative to buying new outfits?\n\n‍\n\nI found this [**template**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/coin-circle-influence-network-worksheet-shelley-hammell/) helpful to map my circle of influence. The template is more sales-y, but I ignored that part and repurposed it for climate conversations/action plans to see whom I could target to have the most impact.\n\n‍\n\nBy mapping my role in my networks, I understood that one of the highest-leverage ways I could bring up climate change was with my former employer. Even though I was new to my career, I found ways to start new sustainability programs by bringing up climate urgency to company executives and getting their buy-in.\n\n \n\n### STEP 4: Build community &amp; talk it out\n\n‍\n\nBig, complex problems need to be tackled *together*. I see this as a way for us to replenish our environmental/social justice batteries and hold each other accountable.\n\n‍\n\nHonestly, what keeps me from giving up on Soapbox is knowing that I have thousands of people counting on me to deliver high-quality, bite-sized action plans. If I didn't have that and the support of my sustainable-minded friends, I may have burnt out by now.\n\n‍\n\nClimate change is urgent, but it doesn't necessarily have to be desperate. A few places on the internet I like to hang out are:\n\n* [**Work on Climate**](http://workonclimate.org/) (Slack)\n* [**Climate Changemakers**](http://climatechangemakers.org/) (Slack)\n* [**Sustainable Asian Traits**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sustainableasiantraits) (FB)\n\n‍\n\n*All We Can Save* also does [**book club circles**](https://www.allwecansave.earth/circles). I've heard great things, but I haven't yet participated.\n\n‍\n\nIf there are any digital communities you love to hang out in, climate-related or not, [**shoot me a note**](mailto:team@soapboxproject.org) and tell me what makes them special.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### STEP 5: Reflect often &amp; build resilient optimism\n\n‍\n\nOne of the hardest things for me is to focus on the big picture. Working full-time as a social entrepreneur can be draining, especially when (in 2020) I don't get to see friends or find externally validating events.\n\n‍\n\nI'm trying to reflect more, write down politics and policy wins, and stay optimistic.\n\n‍\n\nEmily Atkin, author of [**HEATED**](http://heated.world/) newsletter, went on the Reply All podcast at the end of 2020 to help co-host Alex Goldman write a song about his ""impotent rage"" about climate destruction (those are [**real words**](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/episodes) he used, yes). What stuck with me other than the episode's relatability + absurdity was when she said that she feels rage, not despair, about climate change. She says it's a much more productive emotion. I agree, and I feel it's possible to be angry and optimistic at the same time.\n\n‍\n\nI found the [**Climate Journal Project**](https://www.theclimatejournalproject.com/) as a wonderful place to alleviate environmental anxiety. I'm also feeling hopeful about the sheer number of entrepreneurs and changemakers who are making climate justice their #1 priority — yes, the news can be grim, but there are lots of bright, silver spots on the horizon.\n\n‍\n\nFighting climate change is a marathon, not a sprint. (Both are hard, but you get what I mean.) I strongly believe in baby steps. In experimenting with different resources until you find your place. In changing your mind and evolving your opinion, because it's all so complex.\n\n‍\n\nI believe we can make a difference — but it takes all of us, not just as individuals, but as active participants in local government, engaged employees that hold corporations accountable, and community members that are here for each other.\n\n‍\n\nWe got this."

Unfortunately, this was a step that I skipped and ended up trying a solution that I THOUGHT would be helpful instead of getting insight from the farmers.   \n\n\nFrom what I understand now, what are some things that would tremendously benefit local and urban farmers? Whether it be acquiring land, production, maximizing profits etc. I will still get in person interviews but I would like to get some knowledge from you all. Thanks!"

People are jealous because they dont have the newest thing. Newest Playstation,clothes,iPhone, BE PROUD OF WHAT YOU HAVE It's not about ourself all of us must work together.\nIt doesn't even need much effort just eat more vegetables and eco food. Dont leave Lamps on.\nIf no one is in the room. If everyone would do this it would make a huge difference I think. But some people say that they will not live when the climate change is worst. That's fucking selfish. OUR GRANDCHILDREN,CHILDREN AND FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL LIVE THEN. AND IF WE DONT ACT NOW THEY WILL GROW UP IN AN WORLD WHERE TSUNAMIS AND OTHER DISASTERS ARE COMPLETELY NORMAL. AND THE WORST THING ABOUT IT. THEY CANT DO A FUCKING THING ABOUT IT. WE THE CHILDREN OF TODAY MUST ACT NOW.\nIT DOESN'T EVEN NEED MUCH EFFORT. DO ONE THING. JUST IMAGINE THE WHOLE WORLD DOING SMALL THING TOGETHER. THAT COULD POSSIBLY WORK. THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT PEOPLE DONT REALIZE HOW SERIOUS THIS PROBLEM IS BEFORE IT HITS HARD AND THEN ITS TOO LATE. THE ONLY THING THE FUTURE PEOPLE CAN DO IS TO WAIT FOR THIER DEATH.  SOME ADULTS ARE FUCKING DUMB.\nI'm a teenager and today I realized how serious this problem really is. I started crying because this is literally the start of the end of this planet. BUT WE CANT GIVE UP. As of today I will take this problem seriously. The thing is before today I didn't care a thing about climate change. But today I realized how dumb and stupid I have been. We must continue to protest,talk spread this problem so every kid in the world. Understand that this is a really serious problem.\n\nALSO IF WE DONT GIVE OUR BEST.\nWHAT ARE THE FUTURE PEOPLE GONNA THINK ABOUT US. \nPROBABLY THAT WE WERE SELFISH AND STUPID.\n\n\nTHE KIDS NEED TO UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM. BECAUSE  WE ARE THE FUTURE..\nNOT THE ADULTS OF TODAY.\n(WITH THE EXCEPTION OF POLITICIANS AND OTHER POLITICAL INVOLVED PEOPLE. \nMONEY ISNT EVERTHING BECAUSE WITHOUT THIS PLANET WE CANT USE IT ANYWAY.\n\nif you have read the whole text. I want to thank you so much. I became so frustrated today that I haven't realized this earlier. I cried. I wanted to spread this even\nMore. btw I just realised this might have been the wrong place to share this. Anyway I wrote this because now I understand the problem. I will try my best to help all of us. You should also do something as little as eating a little more vegetables. That's not that hard right? Anyway I have accepted the challenge to help stop climate change.  Have a great day."

kq9jzo,"Has the pandemic changed your way of thinking about sustainable living?  \n\nI am wondering if people are now taking their ability to survive at their homes for long periods without shopping every day more seriously and if that will be a trend for the future.\n\nI have been off grid 20 years now and have always kept at least 3 months of dried and canned goods on hand and have the equipment and skills to hunt and fish if necessary and I have chickens for eggs but the pandemic raised my awareness as to areas where my supplies and lifestyle was not as sustainable as I had assumed.\n\nFor one thing I found out fast that having stored foods is great but having lots of just the same foods stored get's boring fast so I added several varieties of canned vegetables and increased my canned fruit, cereals and pasta variations so meals are not boring and more appetizing.\n\nI found out that having condiments and seasonings stored is also necessary and salsa, cheese, and things I use all the time like jalapeno's and of course coffee, sugar, salt, flour, pancake and other bread mixes needed more attention than I was giving them.\n\nPaper goods became vital and while I live alone most of the time I could see a real need for people to have TP, sanitary supplies, soap and other bathing and cleaning supplies stocked up. I went through my paper towels, Clorox and cleaning supplies very fast and had tp make my own out of old towels and basics like vinegar.\n\nMedications became a lot more important and while I don't need any prescription meds thankfully, many people do and I stocked up on OC stuff like Ibuprofen, allergy and cold medicines and refilled my first aid kit for bandages, ointments and I got a digital thermometer, B cuff and O2 tester so I could do basic testing at home. People with diabetes need to consider their testing supplies and medicine supply line.\n\nFuels for my propane water heater, furnace and cooking had to be refilled more and gas for a generator. I cut extra firewood in case I needed that for heat but so far not needed. Trucks were all serviced and ready for winter but I added solar trickle chargers to keep batts full since I am driving less these days.\n\nDog food and chicken food was another area I was deficient in and so I triples my usual supplies so I can keep them fed a few months without a trip for food and if you have animals you may also need other supplies and medications on hand.\n\nKeeping myself entertained and busy took on new meaning and I pulled down my old guitar and restrung it and started playing and writing songs again and I am learning to whittle and working on small projects around the cabin. The internet has been vey useful for contacting family and keeping my small business going and was vital for getting local news as was my emergency radio. I added a 100 watt solar panel and 100AH battery just for a charging station for the laptop, radio, and other gadgets I use all the time. My book collection was poor so I borrowed books from family and ordered a few online.\n\nOnline shopping became my go to instead of local and you of course need accounts and a way to pay for stuff online. if you do that. You might consider a paypal account or debit card instead of credit cards that can get you in debt trouble.\n\nSo, that is my learning experience from the pandemic and areas I needed to address and if you have other areas or ideas that we should be considering please put them in the comments so people can be better prepared and maybe this will become a trend that will help people survive anything that might force us to be more sustainable for long stays at home.\n\nHappy new year, folks!"

Liu\n\nFor more than 15 years, cameraman and ecologist John D. Liu has been working on his worldwide mission to green deserts and to restore biodiversity. It all started in 1995 when Liu filmed the Loess-plateau in China. He witnessed a local population who turned an area of almost the same size as The Netherlands from a dry, exhausted wasteland into one green oasis. This experience changed his life. From that moment on, Liu has been travelling all over the world to convince and inspire government leaders, policy-makers and farmers with his film material and knowledge. Liu diligently spreads the message that restoration of ecosystems is not only possible, but also economically very meaningful. Backlight accompanies Liu on his mission in Jordan and shows on the basis of Liu’s own film material that a green future is possible worldwide."
kqgaa5,"Disposable solar lights, seems counterintuitive We have solar lights barely 2 years old and they stopped working. It seems the panel is non-repairable which makes me quite angry! We bought these as a small environmental effort, and now it just seems like they are more waste. Apparently we cannot find any with replacement parts other than the batteries. These are the kind of outdoor lights that are connected to a single panel. Not individually charging.(Were not electrical engineers by any means, so I’m sure there’s a different option we don’t know about?)"

kqi5ck,"Distraught over city recycling being canceled. Shit, where to start? My husband and I moved to Abilene, TX one year ago. Population 123k. Closest larger town is Ft Worth, 151 miles away. Had to move here for work. Was devastated when I found out they had stopped recycling plastic and glass here right before we had moved. I mean, I cannot take my glass or plastic ANYWHERE to be recycled. I do have a local grocery store that accepts plastic film, thankfully, and for the past year I could recycle paper, cardboard, aluminum, and bi metal cans.\n\nI have always been fairly eco conscious but know i could do more, This past year I have been trying more than ever to drastically reduce my waste. I've had a vegetable garden for many years and managed to grow a decent amount in the small garden here, I reuse shipping supplies when I can for my small business, I cook 90% of our meals, even made eco friendly gift baskets(sans basket) for family and friends this xmas. I try and purchase recycled items when I can. Anyway,, won't go into too much more detail, I know there is always room for more changes, but damn if I'm not trying! and making a lot of improvements. \n\nUnfortunately, there are a lot of things that I have to get delivered to my home, including lots of medical, art, and business supplies. It's been even worse in the pandemic. Being a smaller town, there are not a lot of stores and zero stores that offer bulk shopping options. \n\nThen, several days ago this piece of crap city announced that they will stop recycling paper and cardboard at the end of the month. I am freaking the fuck out. PAPER AND CARDBOARD.\n\nWhen it comes to recycling and reducing waste, I already feel so helpless. The government and businesses are not making good choices and we are paying the price. All we can do is vote, sign petitions, write angry letters, try to educate others, and try to make smarter choices when purchasing things. But, we aren't given many good choices as consumers, we usually have to settle for something that is ""better than what I was doing before but not good enough"". Oh yeah, and we can recycle! Now they've taken that away from me. I feel so fucking helpless. I know that there has been a big problem with recycling facilities all over the country, there aren't enough and they aren't efficient and they cost money. But what the fuck am I supposed to do?! \n\nShit. I guess I just need some folks with similar concerns for the environment to hear my rant. My emotions are already raw from months of quarantine and this is just, rough.\n\nHappy New year and fuck me."

They do refillable bath and body products that are also natural and clean and all those good things we like. I bought my girlfriend a few of their different creams and lotions as we both work towards being more sustainable in our product consumption and we’ve been enjoying the results of the products (nothing drastic but we’ve noticed small improvements in our skin as well as feeling a little better about personal consumer choices). \n\nTheir prices are reasonable and their mission is great! I hope to see them grow and flourish along with other companies that can help us move away from all the single-use plastics. They’re based in the states which is pretty cool too. \n\n(Not certain if this is the right place but want to shine the light on them since they’re new and trying to help fight the good fight 💪)

krr52q,"Signs of Collapse 2020 - Summary of the year Hi /r/Sustainability! I have been working on an ongoing project for 5 years now nick-named [“[Signs of collapse]”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.\n\nI define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.\n\nI’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time.

krshbv,"Cardboard tent vs plastic tent? I just saw an ad promoting cardboard tents to use for festivals. Many people just leave their tents at festivals instead of packing it up- these tents are promoted as a solution to the waste this causes. The cardboard tents are said to be rain proof for 3 days, durable, and can completely decompose. \n\n\n\n\nI'm not someone who leaves their tent behind, but I was wondering if it would be better to just have one single plastic tent that you use until you can't anymore, or if it's better to buy these one off cardboard tents instead (through the lens of zero waste/sustainability/being eco-conscious).

kszuzh,"10 Reasons to Oppose Nuclear Energy ## Ten Strikes Against Nuclear Energy\n\n[https://www.greenamerica.org/fight-dirty-energy/amazon-build-cleaner-cloud/10-reasons-oppose-nuclear-energy](https://www.greenamerica.org/fight-dirty-energy/amazon-build-cleaner-cloud/10-reasons-oppose-nuclear-energy)\n\n## 1. Nuclear waste:\n\nThe waste generated by nuclear reactors remains radioactive for tens to hundreds of thousands of years (1). Currently, there are no long-term storage solutions for radioactive waste, and most is stored in temporary, above-ground facilities. These facilities are running out of storage space, so the nuclear industry is turning to other types of storage that are more costly and potentially less safe (2).\n\n## 2. Nuclear proliferation:\n\nThere is great concern that the development of nuclear energy programs increases the likelihood of proliferation of nuclear weapons. As nuclear fuel and technologies become globally available, the risk of these falling into the wrong hands is increasingly present. To avoid weapons proliferation, it is important that countries with high levels of corruption and instability be discouraged from creating nuclear programs, and the US should be a leader in nonproliferation by not pushing for more nuclear power at home (3).\n\n## 3. National security\n\nNuclear power plants are a potential target for terrorist operations. An attack could cause major explosions, putting population centers at risk, as well as ejecting dangerous radioactive material into the atmosphere and surrounding region. Nuclear research facilities, uranium enrichment plants, and uranium mines are also potentially at risk for attacks that could cause widespread contamination with radioactive material (9).\n\n## 4. Accidents\n\nIn addition to the risks posed by terrorist attacks, human error and natural disasters can lead to dangerous and costly accidents. The 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine led to the deaths of 30 employees in the initial explosion and has has had a variety of negative health effects on thousands across Russia and Eastern Europe. A massive tsunami bypassed the safety mechanisms of several power plants in 2011, causing three nuclear meltdowns at a power plant in Fukushima, Japan, resulting in the release of radioactive materials into the surrounding area. In both disasters, hundreds of thousands were relocated, millions of dollars spent, and the radiation-related deaths are being evaluated to this day. Cancer rates among populations living in proximity to Chernobyl and Fukushima, especially among children, rose significantly in the years after the accidents (4)(5).\n\n## 5. Cancer risk\n\nIn addition to the significant risk of cancer associated with fallout from nuclear disasters, studies also show increased risk for those who reside near a nuclear power plant, especially for childhood cancers such as leukemia (6)(7)(8). Workers in the nuclear industry are also exposed to higher than normal levels of radiation, and as a result are at a higher risk of death from cancer (10).\n\n## 6. Energy production\n\nThe 444 nuclear power plants currently in existence provide about 11% of the world’s energy (11). Studies show that in order to meet current and future energy needs, the nuclear sector would have to scale up to around 14,500 plants. Uranium, the fuel for nuclear reactors, is energy-intensive to mine, and deposits discovered in the future are likely to be harder to get to to. As a result, much of the net energy created would be offset by the energy input required to build and decommission plants and to mine and process uranium ore. The same is true for any reduction in greenhouse gas emissions brought about by switching from coal to nuclear (12).\n\n## 7. Not enough sites\n\nScaling up to 14,500 nuclear plants isn’t possible simply due to the limitation of feasible sites. Nuclear plants need to be located near a source of water for cooling, and there aren’t enough locations in the world that are safe from droughts, flooding, hurricanes, earthquakes, or other potential disasters that could trigger a nuclear accident. The increase in extreme weather events predicted by climate models only compounds this risk.\n\n## 8. Cost\n\nUnlike renewables, which are now the cheapest energy sources, nuclear costs are on the rise, and many plants are being shut down or in danger of being shut down for economic reasons. Initial capital costs, fuel, and maintenance costs are much higher for nuclear plants than wind and solar, and nuclear projects tend to suffer [cost overruns](https://www.greenamerica.org/blog/more-evidence-strike-8-against-nuclear-power) and construction delays. The price of renewable energy has fallen significantly over the past decade, and it projected to continue to fall (14).\n\n## 9. Competition with renewables\n\nInvestment in nuclear plants, security, mining infrastructure, etc. draws funding away from investment in cleaner sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal. Financing for renewable energy is already scarce, and increasing nuclear capacity will only add to the competition for funding.\n\n## 10. Energy dependence of poor countries\n\nGoing down the nuclear route would mean that poor countries, that don't have the financial resources to invest in and develop nuclear power, would become reliant on rich, technologically advanced nations. Alternatively, poor nations without experience in the building and maintaining of nuclear plants may decide to build them anyway. Countries with a history of nuclear power use have learned the importance of regulation, oversight, and investment in safety when it comes to nuclear. Dr. Peter Bradford of Vermont Law, a former member of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, writes, ""A world more reliant on nuclear power would involve many plants in countries that have little experience with nuclear energy, no regulatory background in the field and some questionable records on quality control, safety and corruption."" (15). The U.S. should lead by example and encourage poor countries to invest in safe energy technology.\n\nArticle originally written by Green America's Todd Larsen and Alisa Gravitz in 2006.\n\nPlease also see the piece [Nuclear Energy is not a Climate Solution](https://www.greenamerica.org/nuclear-power-not-climate-solution)\n\n(1) Bruno, J., and R.

kt10rj,"10 Reasons to Oppose Nuclear Energy  \n\n# Ten Strikes Against Nuclear Energy\n\n[https://www.greenamerica.org/fight-dirty-energy/amazon-build-cleaner-cloud/10-reasons-oppose-nuclear-energy](https://www.greenamerica.org/fight-dirty-energy/amazon-build-cleaner-cloud/10-reasons-oppose-nuclear-energy)\n\n1. Nuclear waste:\n\nThe waste generated by nuclear reactors remains radioactive for tens to hundreds of thousands of years (1). Currently, there are no long-term storage solutions for radioactive waste, and most is stored in temporary, above-ground facilities. These facilities are running out of storage space, so the nuclear industry is turning to other types of storage that are more costly and potentially less safe (2).\n\n2. Nuclear proliferation:\n\nThere is great concern that the development of nuclear energy programs increases the likelihood of proliferation of nuclear weapons. As nuclear fuel and technologies become globally available, the risk of these falling into the wrong hands is increasingly present. To avoid weapons proliferation, it is important that countries with high levels of corruption and instability be discouraged from creating nuclear programs, and the US should be a leader in nonproliferation by not pushing for more nuclear power at home (3).\n\n3. National security\n\nNuclear power plants are a potential target for terrorist operations. An attack could cause major explosions, putting population centers at risk, as well as ejecting dangerous radioactive material into the atmosphere and surrounding region. Nuclear research facilities, uranium enrichment plants, and uranium mines are also potentially at risk for attacks that could cause widespread contamination with radioactive material (9).\n\n4. Accidents\n\nIn addition to the risks posed by terrorist attacks, human error and natural disasters can lead to dangerous and costly accidents. The 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine led to the deaths of 30 employees in the initial explosion and has has had a variety of negative health effects on thousands across Russia and Eastern Europe. A massive tsunami bypassed the safety mechanisms of several power plants in 2011, causing three nuclear meltdowns at a power plant in Fukushima, Japan, resulting in the release of radioactive materials into the surrounding area. In both disasters, hundreds of thousands were relocated, millions of dollars spent, and the radiation-related deaths are being evaluated to this day. Cancer rates among populations living in proximity to Chernobyl and Fukushima, especially among children, rose significantly in the years after the accidents (4)(5).\n\n5. Cancer risk\n\nIn addition to the significant risk of cancer associated with fallout from nuclear disasters, studies also show increased risk for those who reside near a nuclear power plant, especially for childhood cancers such as leukemia (6)(7)(8). Workers in the nuclear industry are also exposed to higher than normal levels of radiation, and as a result are at a higher risk of death from cancer (10).\n\n6. Energy production\n\nThe 444 nuclear power plants currently in existence provide about 11% of the world’s energy (11). Studies show that in order to meet current and future energy needs, the nuclear sector would have to scale up to around 14,500 plants. Uranium, the fuel for nuclear reactors, is energy-intensive to mine, and deposits discovered in the future are likely to be harder to get to to. As a result, much of the net energy created would be offset by the energy input required to build and decommission plants and to mine and process uranium ore. The same is true for any reduction in greenhouse gas emissions brought about by switching from coal to nuclear (12).\n\n7. Not enough sites\n\nScaling up to 14,500 nuclear plants isn’t possible simply due to the limitation of feasible sites. Nuclear plants need to be located near a source of water for cooling, and there aren’t enough locations in the world that are safe from droughts, flooding, hurricanes, earthquakes, or other potential disasters that could trigger a nuclear accident. The increase in extreme weather events predicted by climate models only compounds this risk.\n\n8. Cost\n\nUnlike renewables, which are now the cheapest energy sources, nuclear costs are on the rise, and many plants are being shut down or in danger of being shut down for economic reasons. Initial capital costs, fuel, and maintenance costs are much higher for nuclear plants than wind and solar, and nuclear projects tend to suffer [cost overruns](https://www.greenamerica.org/blog/more-evidence-strike-8-against-nuclear-power) and construction delays. The price of renewable energy has fallen significantly over the past decade, and it projected to continue to fall (14).\n\n9. Competition with renewables\n\nInvestment in nuclear plants, security, mining infrastructure, etc. draws funding away from investment in cleaner sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal. Financing for renewable energy is already scarce, and increasing nuclear capacity will only add to the competition for funding.\n\n10. Energy dependence of poor countries\n\nGoing down the nuclear route would mean that poor countries, that don't have the financial resources to invest in and develop nuclear power, would become reliant on rich, technologically advanced nations. Alternatively, poor nations without experience in the building and maintaining of nuclear plants may decide to build them anyway. Countries with a history of nuclear power use have learned the importance of regulation, oversight, and investment in safety when it comes to nuclear. Dr. Peter Bradford of Vermont Law, a former member of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, writes, ""A world more reliant on nuclear power would involve many plants in countries that have little experience with nuclear energy, no regulatory background in the field and some questionable records on quality control, safety and corruption."" (15). The U.S. should lead by example and encourage poor countries to invest in safe energy technology.\n\nArticle originally written by Green America's Todd Larsen and Alisa Gravitz in 2006.\n\nPlease also see the piece [Nuclear Energy is not a Climate Solution](https://www.greenamerica.org/nuclear-power-not-climate-solution)\n\n(1) Bruno, J., and R.

Nuclear waste:**\n\nThe waste generated by nuclear reactors remains radioactive for tens to hundreds of thousands of years (1). Currently, there are no long-term storage solutions for radioactive waste, and most is stored in temporary, above-ground facilities. These facilities are running out of storage space, so the nuclear industry is turning to other types of storage that are more costly and potentially less safe (2).\n\n**2.

To avoid weapons proliferation, it is important that countries with high levels of corruption and instability be discouraged from creating nuclear programs, and the US should be a leader in nonproliferation by not pushing for more nuclear power at home (3).\n\n**3. National security**\n\nNuclear power plants are a potential target for terrorist operations. An attack could cause major explosions, putting population centers at risk, as well as ejecting dangerous radioactive material into the atmosphere and surrounding region. Nuclear research facilities, uranium enrichment plants, and uranium mines are also potentially at risk for attacks that could cause widespread contamination with radioactive material (9).\n\n**4. Accidents**\n\nIn addition to the risks posed by terrorist attacks, human error and natural disasters can lead to dangerous and costly accidents. The 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine led to the deaths of 30 employees in the initial explosion and has has had a variety of negative health effects on thousands across Russia and Eastern Europe. A massive tsunami bypassed the safety mechanisms of several power plants in 2011, causing three nuclear meltdowns at a power plant in Fukushima, Japan, resulting in the release of radioactive materials into the surrounding area. In both disasters, hundreds of thousands were relocated, millions of dollars spent, and the radiation-related deaths are being evaluated to this day.

Nuclear plants need to be located near a source of water for cooling, and there aren’t enough locations in the world that are safe from droughts, flooding, hurricanes, earthquakes, or other potential disasters that could trigger a nuclear accident. The increase in extreme weather events predicted by climate models only compounds this risk.\n\n**8. Cost**\n\nUnlike renewables, which are now the cheapest energy sources, nuclear costs are on the rise, and many plants are being shut down or in danger of being shut down for economic reasons. Initial capital costs, fuel, and maintenance costs are much higher for nuclear plants than wind and solar, and nuclear projects tend to suffer [cost overruns](https://www.greenamerica.org/blog/more-evidence-strike-8-against-nuclear-power) and construction delays. The price of renewable energy has fallen significantly over the past decade, and it projected to continue to fall (14).\n\n**9. Competition with renewables**\n\nInvestment in nuclear plants, security, mining infrastructure, etc. draws funding away from investment in cleaner sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal. Financing for renewable energy is already scarce, and increasing nuclear capacity will only add to the competition for funding.\n\n**10. Energy dependence of poor countries**\n\nGoing down the nuclear route would mean that poor countries, that don't have the financial resources to invest in and develop nuclear power, would become reliant on rich, technologically advanced nations. Alternatively, poor nations without experience in the building and maintaining of nuclear plants may decide to build them anyway.

However, in the future these digital mirrors might the the standard and the efficiency gain of drag reduction is 'free'.\n\nThis is just one question regarding the category transportation/mobility/cars, but it could be anything as long as it's connected to sustainability.\n\nIf this is not the correct subreddit, my apologies!"

kvnym3,"Who are we to blame Brazil for rainforest destruction when our own consumption patterns are, in fact, the root cause of the problem? Above all, the consumption of animal products in wealthy “developed countries” is responsible for over 70% of rainforest destruction in South America, and generally the strongest driver of deforestation and desertification globally. Animal agriculture (with all its pastures and feed production) already occupies one third of all ice-free land on this planet, which is equal to all usable land of Australia, China, Europe, and North America, combined. Why is that? The short answer: Animal products are incredibly inefficient. While over 20,000 people die from hunger and malnutrition every day, you need about 100 calories of grain to produce 12 calories of chicken or 3 calories of beef. This requires a significant amount of land. Over the last 25 years alone, forests have been cleared from an area the size of India. Consequently, animal and plant species are dying off around the world at the fastest rate since the mass-extinction event that killed the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Our planet is suffering and we are heading towards a point of no return. What can we do about it? One of the simplest and most effective answers is leaving animal products off your plate and inspire your friends to do the same. While the reasons outlined above should easily suffice, there are many other important reasons to go vegan — do it for the world’s hungry, for the animals, for the environment and for your own health. I know it might seem really hard to give up on animal products but please believe that it will literally change your life for the better. If you have any questions about making the transition, please ask away :-) Thanks for reading this my friends.\n\noriginal post: [https://www.facebook.com/jacob.kroger.5/posts/4044473048925029](https://www.facebook.com/jacob.kroger.5/posts/4044473048925029)"

kwoi22,"Are there any material resources which, if suddenly not available, would halt or challenge future technical development? Hi! I’m currently watching a short youtumentary about climate change where they touched upon recycling steel. I observed in the footage that what they were melting contained a lot of other (likely valuable) materials that would just burn and become gas or ash. I had to pause and find this subreddit, because the question that came to my mind scares me. The question is in the title, but the longer question is as follows:\n\n**Are there any materials (e.g. elements of the periodic table or natural resources) which, if not available due to being overlooked and obliterated as part of previous recycling efforts of another resource, would halt or significantly delay or challenge the future technical development in any specific field?**\n\nFor example, ”without resource X, we will not be able to make anymore screens for TVs or smartphones” or ”without resource Y, we will not be able to make anymore computer chips, ever”. \n\n(Another way to ask the same question would be: ”If we obliterated every existing occurence of a specific element of the periodic table (e.g. gold), would it make future development impossible within any technical development areas?”)\n\nThe question is of concern for me, because I do encourage recycling efforts. However, if such efforts mean that we little by little obliterate necessary material that we can’t renew within reasonable time, I don’t know how to cope."

kzhyb9,"Does anyone know credible guides to sustainable, conventional building? Tl;dr: I am finishing a basement living room, wall rebuild, and bathroom. If I look up for an eco friendly option of paint, drywall, etc or see one at my job at \[Big Box Hardware Store\], I can't help but worry about greenwashing and past scandals with forestry initiatives that are ""Socially Responsible"" turning out to actually source their wood illegally from old growth forests or such. Like we go through shitloads of plastic a night unboxing products; how are vinyl tiles 'environmentally friendly'? \n\nSo I need to put up a wall over studs, and shiplap is hundreds of dollars for what $10 of drywall would be. Looking at drywall and there's a buncha different brands, some with Sustainalytics approval, some marketed as eco-friendly, etc. \n\nBut if I look up drywall's environmental impact, I get very contradicting reports. Like, an earthen plaster company that costs 30x the cost of normal drywall says drywall is evil, but a different blog say it's not- it's actually very sustainable. Academia has mixed, confusing reports that are hundreds of pages long, or no reports at all that can be used to inform a consumer. And when you ask if you can use plaster, you get weird looks. \n\n I've done papers on hemp's use in building, and I know it's brilliant and could create a product to replace drywall entirely without needing the consumer or building style to change, as well as a replacement for paper, cloth, masonry, concrete, etc- but it's not an option on the market yet; hemp is, iirc, still illegal in my state in America. And I live at home, like most young adults rn: I can't start digging a hole in the yard to make cob, or reject the homeowner's wishes for a renovation project. \n\nJust thought I'd use Reddit's 'hive-mind' and see if anyone here has dealt with sustainable building info overload, or knows which sources to trust vs not? \n\nI could explain what I mean by conventional, if that bothers anyone. But uh, it's just kinda riffing off this scale: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright\_green\_environmentalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright_green_environmentalism). \n\nConventional vs futuristic vs back-to-nature buildings; regular, normal DIYer vs building of the future, solar panels, new materials, billions of dollahs, mass societal change and zoning regulations lifted, vs ""Quit job, leave society, build homestead, composting toilet"""

I love my neighborhood, as it is incredibly diverse with a lot of people active in neighborly/hood activities.  I've never felt more at home in a community.\n\nAs part of the master plan for my neighborhood, we have a ton of vacant lots.  The idea is that the neighborhood association buys up empty lots, or buys up housing that will be torn down, with the eventual goal for these to be sold to people who want to build, or to developers.  It's been slow going for a variety of reasons, but still heading on that trajectory.  (And, this is all with an active eye to guard against gentrification, which as a poor person, I greatly appreciate.)\n\nThe empty lots are currently grass, and mowed.  As someone who is interested in sustainability, native plants, prairie revitalization, etc., I wondered if we could transform these lots into something else a little nicer for the environment than bioconcrete, and maybe that would need less or no mowing as well.  I appreciate any ideas that flow this way.  Thanks!"

After reading many posts on this sub, I’m pretty convinced the best way to even have a hope for reversing climate change is to start holding Corporations accountable for carbon emissions and waste (and hopefully eventually working conditions and social impact). But I have not seen anything on how this could actually be implemented. Like would this be a tax that corporations have to pay to offset their emissions? Would their be an “emissions threshold” that corporations could not exceed without legal ramifications? Is there one policy that the majority of this community is pushing for?

l28l7m,"How I sustainably got furniture for my new home almost for free This is a really quick post on how I set up my new apartment almost for free! This was my first time ever participating in the circular economy and buying secondhand. Until 2020, I had barely any idea how easy it was to get clean, matching, tasteful furniture that's been purchased by someone else.\n\n‍\n\nI hope you find some valuable resources below for your next move. Buying secondhand has brought me so much joy — it's helped me feel spontaneous because I don't have an exact furniture plan, it's saved me tons of money, and it's brought me closer to my neighbors while fighting climate change.\n\n‍\n\nMy house has been coming together really well and it's as if the furniture gets to decide the look and feel of the place. Finding ways to be sustainable is giving me joy during the pandemic!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. [Original post](https://www.soapboxproject.org/journal/how-i-set-up-my-new-home-buying-nothing-secondhand) is part of my bite-sized action plans to fight climate change. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are the main ways I furnished my 1x1 house. We have a kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, and living room that we've sectioned into half-living half-dining with a desk in the corner.\n\n1. **The Buy Nothing Project.** I went through the [**Buy Nothing Project**](http://buynothingproject.org/) for most of my stuff. It's an entirely gift-based economy!Buy Nothing has been amazing for so many reasons. First of all, you join a neighborhood-specific group, which means you can basically walk to most places to get stuff. I dragged 5 IKEA chairs from two neighbors' houses — coincidentally, they formed a matching set and it was totally unplanned!Second of all, it's free. I don't need to explain that too much, but it's made me feel more generous with my possessions. Buy Nothing has been a far more positive experience than Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, etc. because you give and receive with no strings attached. It's  amazing.Third of all, it's the only place I know where you can give/receive stuff that wouldn't be acceptable in something like Goodwill. Opened spice bottle only used once? Check. Sewing supplies that are out of the box? Check.**What I got from Buy Nothing so far:** Buy Nothing honestly changed my life. I'm not exaggerating. I got a queen bed, two nightstands, a bookshelf, the cutest corner desk in the world, a monitor, coffee table, five matching chairs, nails, puzzle mat tiles, herb scissors, a toaster, and a yoga mat within a month. I've given a ton of stuff too.\n\n[ Bed and nightstands from Buy Nothing ](https://preview.redd.it/n59eunkr9rc61.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85b9d4b20c87c178930a38eaa3589070d426ffc2)\n\n2.  **Facebook Marketplace.** If you've spent any time on Facebook, you've probably had the Marketplace feature increasingly intrude onto your feed and navigation buttons. That used to be a pain in my butt, but now I go on Marketplace all the time to pick up local items. It's really convenient — it's not as great as Buy Nothing because it's often draining to negotiate a price and have people flake on you, but we got some amazing dishware and rugs through it!**What I got from Marketplace so far:** two awesome rugs for $40, an entire dishware set (bowls, mugs, plates, small plates) + Pyrex measuring cups + a spatula for $5, other random kitchen stuff like an electric beater and dish towels for $7, a HUGE dining table for $20, and an entertainment center for $20\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Dining table from FB marketplace. It expands into a giant circle! ](https://preview.redd.it/2lcirngv9rc61.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfc98bd158e5c6d4f149e2eff7e56dc761b60764)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. OfferUp.** [**OfferUp**](http://offerup.com/) is the same concept as FB Marketplace but it's its own app. They have more verification in place and I found it to be less flakey than Facebook.**What I got from OfferUp so far:** Our beautiful sectional couch + delivery for $175 and a TV.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q4fm0sux9rc61.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe4828ad3f9f658f1ad3258d376ac70035ad7c79\n\n4. **Craigslist.** This one's pretty obvious and you might know all about it, but we got some stuff like a used-once Instant Pot from [**Craigslist**](http://craigslist.org/). They have an entire free section too, if that's your thing. Craigslist is the last place I look because it's much harder to navigate and the free stuff on there often looks like garbage, but it's worth a shot.**What I got from Craigslist so far:** an Instant Pot and a mesh strainer for $30\n\n‍\n\nIf you're looking to be trendy and sustainable on a budget, hope this helped! I'll update as I get more stuff/find more resources.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGet my [free bite-sized action plans here](https://www.soapboxproject.org) if you're looking for more easy/joyful ways to fight climate change!"

They would like to use this to explore options for packaging to make it more sustainable from shelf to post product life.\n\nIn her own words “I would be very grateful if you could fill in my survey for my final year dissertation project.

I am possibly coming around to the idea for the functionality I would be able to get out of it. \n\nHowever, can I make a (very slightly) lower impact and improve the sustainability of my product purchase with the material/band selection? \n\nThe band material options include: \n-liquid silicone rubber (LSR)\n-polyester yarn braided around silicone thread (description says it is made from 100% recycled material)\n-fluoroelastomer \n-woven nylon\n-leather\n-stainless steel\n\nSynthetics (nylon, polyester) are not biodegradable and rely on petrochem for the raw material. However the polyester yarn braided around silicone thread is made from 100% recycled material so would that be better than creating demand for newly extracted materials?\n\nSilicones are made from sand, but from my rudimentary research, LSR is a synthetic resin. Also fluoroelastomer is a synthetic rubber. So is there really a benefit to either of those materials? \n\nLeather- is presumably made from some animal, though I am not sure where to find details about it. It can be made from skin from animals raised for their meat so it can be a byproduct and doesn’t need additional land and resources, and is generally fairly durable. \n\nStainless steel- could be made with some quantity of recycled content in it. Is the resources to fill the demand of creating it higher than the other options? \n\nIs there something else I can think about to try to reduce impact while making this purchase? I am still concerned about what could happen at the end of life of the product, but perhaps Apple will be doing smart watch recycling then too in addition to their current old devices program. \n\nThe case comes in aluminum, stainless steel, or titanium. I would likely get aluminum, but am open to reasons for the others if it makes sense."

Do you know how they're actually making an impact?  \n\n\nRose not only shares info on their mission &amp; how they're achieving a win-win-win, she also shares so many gems on her actual job! Here's some highlights on what we learned from her. [Here's the full Q&amp;A!](https://www.soapboxproject.org/journal/imperfect-foods-ugly-produce-food-waste)  \n\n\n1. 🤯 Each month, Imperfect Foods purchases over four million pounds of food that otherwise would have been undervalued. Produce, for example, could be tilled under, composted, landfilled, sold to a processor, or placed on the open consignment market where items have a higher likelihood of going to waste.  \n\n\n2. ✈️ When COVID disrupted business models, Imperfect Foods stepped in to save food — they saved and sold airline snacks like cheese trays destined for JetBlue flights and popcorn for movie theaters!  \n\n\n3. 🚘 In 2020, Imperfect Foods' last mile delivery system emitted around 13,000 tCO2e less than the US average for car trips to the grocery store for the same deliveries. That’s the equivalent of taking 2,800 cars off the road for a year.  \n\n\n4. 👔 Five things that will help you if you're considering a career in sustainability (or making change at your workplace) are making the financial case for sustainability, making initiatives company-wide, flexing your analytical skills, writing effectively, and bringing joy and inclusion.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ep92ipu6lyd61.png?width=4320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb1d61adccfa2f121fadad0fc0312a644780b15d\n\n5. ✍🏽 One of the best ways to take action as a consumer is to write to the companies you purchase from and tell them what you want them to see them do. Share your values, why sustainability is important, etc.  \n\n\nFind bite-sized climate actions [here](https://www.soapboxproject.org) and let me know if you have any more questions or people you recommend interviewing!"

l785sh,"The Way Out Of This Mess I'm writing a manifesto that details a way to step by step make a more sustainable post-scarcity world the Prologue focuses on how fucked we are:\n\nPeople….. we’re fucked. I mean like reeeaaaally fucked. I’m writing this at the tail end of 2020, we are in the midst of a global pandemic. Due to which many people have restricted their lives, leading to a 7% drop in carbon emissions ⁽¹⁾. In spite of all this, 2020 is shaping up to be, if not the top, at least in the top 3 warmest years on record⁽²⁾. Climate change isn’t coming, it’s here.\n\nIt’s not just the climate though. Income inequality is the highest it’s been in 50 years⁽³⁾. Political Polarization is at levels not seen since the last civil war. Which is keeping us from foreseeing the upcoming Thucydides Trap, and employment crisis due to automation. Human civilization is rushing headlong into a cyberpunk dystopia.\n\nIf we don’t do something and fast then we can kiss this “Long Peace” goodbye. Now I’m not the only one to think this, even mainstream news outlets have caught on that the jig is coming to an end. Plenty of people are looking to solve our current problems through ideological means. The revitalized American left seems mainly to think that through electoralism they can shift American policy enough to avoid the impending climate catastrophe. To put that in perspective the IPCC says that to mitigate the worst effect of climate change on human society, we should limit warming to 1.5℃ above preindustrial levels⁽⁴⁾. That is not to avoid climate change that’s just to mitigate the worst effects. 2016 was 1.1℃ above preindustrial levels⁽⁵⁾. The WMO says that we will hit 1.5℃ above preindustrial levels by 2024⁽⁶⁾. To be honest given the current geopolitical situation we can kiss our nice stable climate goodbye. That doesn’t mean that there’s no hope, it just means we have to switch the current paradigm of thinking around climate change.\n\nThe current idea is that we will get all the nations on earth, to drastically reduce their CO₂ emissions and keep them down. Not only does this require levels of global cooperation never before seen, but it also disproportionately benefits rich countries who have the money to transition to cleaner fuels; that’s just for the climate issue. Instead of relying on a moonshot that the world is consistently making more and more infeasible, I propose a different approach. Instead of waiting for governments to change, I propose we change. Instead of hoping that the climate doesn’t change, I propose we change so that it doesn’t matter. If we’re are not only going to survive but thrive in the next 50 years, then we need to, with intention, plan out a route from our current catastrophe through sustainability the lands us in a promising future.\n\nWe can create a better society, we have to create a better society. One that can stand up to the problems of climate change, and wealth inequality, and finally secure a basic livelihood for all. To do this we need to realize that there are two major fronts that demand attention and intention. That being the technical issues of how to build a climate change-resistant, sustainable society; and the epistemological how to organize that society sustainable, equitably, and such that it doesn’t collapse. Now this book is strictly meant to deal with the technological side of this issue. Though if you subscribe to certain sociological theories then the technological mode of production implies a certain sociological structure.\n\nThis book is more of an introduction to the types of solutions we could apply to the problem of work and non-sustainable production. I have limited my scope to make the task manageable however, this means that not everyone can partake in the society that I am laying out. I don’t take this to mean that there is not a sustainable solution for all, it just means that I cannot as an individual find it. I propose that the approach I take in this book can be applied by others to their own circumstances to produce similar results.\n\nResources: full bibliography in final book\n\nI'm publishing it in parts on: [https://medium.com/the-way-out-of-this-mess](https://medium.com/the-way-out-of-this-mess)"

l83co5,"I think it is hard to find users for green projects where the direct benefits are not big (but contamination is reduced for instance). I'm facing it  This  is only an idea, I haven't developed anything at this moment, but I  have been thinking and discussing about this for the whole last year.\n\nThe  objective of this project is to help in the task of reducing methane  emissions, concretely I focused on farms (this is such a big source of  methane).\n\nThe aim of the project  is to connect farmers with biogas companies, so the manure (waste  generated by animals such as pigs or cows) can be used to generate clean  energy (biogas),  instead of being storaged (in that case, the methane  shall be released to the atmosphere, and that is a well-known  contamination problem, and 2030 agenda aims to reduce this among other  objectives). As far as I know, there is no penalty for that  contamination.\n\nThe main point of  the idea is to organize farms subscribed to the same biogas plant within  each small region, so the transport would collect the manure from farms  near the plant and would deliver it there in order to generate biogas.\n\nThe  main issue found here is that the farmers won't be motivated to  register to this service, even if they help to take care of the  environment by doing this (generating clean energy, helping biogas  companies to create more plants, and reducing the amount of methane  released). Honestly, I do think they won't find any direct benefit (even  if they are helping the environment), because I am not adding any real  value for them. They wouldn't obtain discounts for supplies for  instance.\n\nThe only way I have  found to ""motivate"" the farmers to register is to also allow them to do  business within the platform (such as post ads, bargain between farmers  that are not near enough to negotiate face to face, or let company  supplies to register there too). It would be like a professional network  but oriented to their sector (i.e. startups, companies, farmers would  be able to exchange products, services or feedback even if they are  maybe too far to talk face-to-face).\n\nHow would you motivate potential users to use green solutions, even if they don't obtain a direct benefit from it?\n\nThanks for reading!"

l8nzsy,"What Is The Solution medium link: [https://medium.com/the-way-out-of-this-mess/chapter-1-what-is-the-solution-1ad34e7bda36](https://medium.com/the-way-out-of-this-mess/chapter-1-what-is-the-solution-1ad34e7bda36)\n\nThe solution is the decommodification of everything through sustainability, automation, and essentialism. Easy right? In more concrete terms, the solution is to strengthen the relationship between production, consumption, and sustainability. The solution is to design society in such a way that things are not just produced, for-profit; but actually for the benefit of humanity as a whole. This means abandoning the concepts of money, unending growth, and thoughtless consumption. And instead of building a society based around community, intention, and sustainability. To do this it is not possible to work within the current bounds of liberal democracy. It is also not advisable to try and seek a violent nonconsensual revolution.\n\nLet’s go over what I just postulated in detail. Decommodification is the process of taking things that were once traded as commodities (i.e. for our purposes branded products in a capitalist market) and turning them into something else. A good example of what this looks like is the free u-pick fields in the Midwestern United States. These are fields of usually blueberries that have been left to grow and now are a community resource that you can harvest from freely. Another example from before capitalism took hold were the British commons before the enclosure movement. These resources weren’t traded weren’t branded they were just resources that existed. Making resources the property of all is not the only way to decommodify resources. For soldiers in the American military, MRE and other government equipment are not commodified.\n\nSustainability can be hard and nebulous, to define. It’s often much easier to start off with what not sustainable; and then try and postulate what a world without those things might look like. Therefore a world with no unsustainable elements = a more sustainable world. Things that are unsustainable usually produce nothing of usable value to either nature or humans after they have been used. Due to the nature of thermodynamics, everything will eventually end up in this state. But how long it takes to reach that state give a good metric by which we can measure the sustainability of a given object (how long until everything associated with it is unusable), or a system (what sustainable vs unsustainable distribution does it produce), or a society (how do many of the systems which make up a society are sustainable). By this definition, there are very few things that are unsustainable but there are plenty of things that aren’t that sustainable. For example, many plastics are considered unsustainable because once they are used they can’t be recycled into new high-value items. But they can be used for all sorts of things they are just of lower value (building material, decoration, synthetic thread, etc). So we see that certain plastics can be rated on how after each use how much value does it lose after each use (both to humans, and to the environment). And how other plastics such as bioplastics, for example, are very sustainable because after reuse they maintain a larger percentage of their value and actually gain value to the environment. Applied to products this means practices like planned obsolescence are unsustainable because they are built upon the product losing value over its lifecycle. Applied to systems this means that inflation is usually unsustainable as it makes the store of value such as the dollar lose value overtime with no gain in its worth to the environment.\n\nAutomation is not really that hard to pin down it is the completion of labor (the process of adding or transmuting value) being done by a non-human autonomous(self-managing) agent. That means tool use is not necessarily automation having a better axe does not make one’s job more automated. Usually, this takes place when machinery’s lifetime cost is less than that of a human laborer’s. This can only happen however is the machinery’s initial cost can be paid. Integrated automated systems lead to an astonishing network effect of rapid and efficient just in time manufacturing.\n\nEssentialism is an offshoot of the minimalist movement, with minimalism being a response to hyper-consumerism. The goal of both minimalism and essentialism is to consume less. Essentialism goes about this by practicing “the disciplined pursuit of less”. What I am advocating for is not the mainstream version of either minimalism or essentialism. What I’m advocating for is what I’d like to call “the disciplined pursuit of nonsuperfluous self”. Which combines the tenants of Essentialism, Non-Alienated labor, and Zen Buddhism. The idea is to have an intimate relationship with the things you come to possess by making sure you only possess things that you truly care about. What this looks like is when let’s say you need new jeans you either find an artisan that knows how to make jeans and make an arrangement by which you receive jeans you love and they are fairly compensated, or you learn the craft of making jeans or realizing that the particular type of jean does not matter to you go and get a generic utilitarian, comfy pair.\n\nPutting all these concepts together results in something magical. Completely automating the supply chains of things allows for those things to become decommodified without having to endure the “tragedy of the commons”. Through this, you can then treat those automated decommodified supply chains like you would a 3D printer meaning that for essentialist consumption it allows you to customize every step of the manufacturing process allowing consumers to have more say in the products they consume, ultimately leading to less waste, and more self-identification with the product. This whole system can be engineered from a systems design approach from the beginning with a mathematical definition of sustainability in it from the start allowing for it to rated on sustainability.\n\nAs long as these things can be produced sustainably after the startup costs are recuperated the things produced by these supply chains need not be bought or sold. The end result of this means that there is such a way in which you could set up a society like ancient Athens where for the citizens the basic necessities of life can be guaranteed without cost to anyone. This society is the solution, a society where production, consumption, and sustainability are inseparably intertwined. This society where things are produced for the benefit of each and every member of the society. This society in which money is a construct of the past, where consumption is not the rule of the day."

How is it that a “small” group of people on one subreddit brought the whole financial world to its knees?\n\nI think we are at the dawn of a new era where we can have a large influence on how corporations operate. If you actually go to r/wallstreetbets you’ll see how many people are in this not for pure financial gain but to make a statement, a statement against the 1%. In this way, ironically, they were more successful at getting Wall Street/congress to listen than the Occupy Wall Street Movement. Hedge funds are no longer going to short companies out of existence because they know WE can disrupt their nonsense. \n\nBut what if, instead of just doing this one time event to specifically “stick it to the man,” we did it to specifically target sustainability in business.

This will be a portion of the economy that people can visually associate with environmental efforts and I would like to understand the next level of this. \n\n Criteria for this is:\n\n* ability to seal product from environment\n* biodegradability/ recyclability/ persistence in environment\n* ability to have additional marketing on the medium (and sustainability of additional marketing)\n* land use of medium\n* toxicity during production and lifespan of medium\n* energy consumption of medium\n\nObviously certain packaging is better for certain items, so please discern as much as you please.\n\nMy judgements are as follows:\n\n* General solids packaging (chips, bars, bags of flour)- I personally like aluminum foil-esque products due to recyclability. I encasement is required (typically not and is something that could be removed in food packaging) cardboard due to recyclability and biodegradability\n* Liquids: Aluminum due to recyclability and glass. Glass recycle chain is not as developed.\n* Semi-solids (toothpaste) : This is tough. Personally I prefer aluminum (recyclability) with some sort of aluminum device to scoop it out.\n* Packaging Material: Cardboard boxes are good. Packing peanuts/ bubble can be reduced with some sort of wood/fiber/ cloth product that is more biodegradable\n* Food Takeout: Biodegradable wood/ fiber substrate. This one is the most egregious due to high Styrofoam use and should be eliminated.\n\nIn all this I realize plastic is good for being able to see the quality of the product before using, but I thing that this is overrated. We don't see a lot of products before utilization and if we can reduce the wear and tear of the planet then we can sacrifice this ""convenience.""\n\nI look forward to hearing any opinions and hope that this can be a thread to spread some cool ideas."

This society is contingent upon a few axioms:\n\n1. The Axiom of Choice/Free Association. If someone decides to join this society it’s completely a free choice of theirs.\n\nThis axiom means that we have to locate this society in a place that has little to no current population. This also means that people born in this society must retain the citizenship of the parents and that there will be no native citizens of the society.\n\n2. The Axiom of explicitness. There are no agreements that have not been made explicitly clear.\n\nThis axiom means that any social contracts are actual contracts signed by all whom they pertain to.\n\n3. The Axiom of Self-Reliance. All basic necessities for the whole population must be provided by production in the society\n\nWere this not to be the case then foreign powers would hold the real power.\n\nThese axioms when they interact limit the scope of possibilities, to several lightly to uninhabited locations (because of axiom 1). That are either geothermal active or, near a geothermal hotspot(because of axiom 3 applied to energy). When mapping all the remaining locations out this is what it looks like with somewhat loose criteria.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter narrowing down to the possible locations we can start to in detail plan out a human and environmental centered economy.\n\nWe have the most information on what a current typical first-world human needs so let’s start there.\n\nObviously people food, water shelter, and clothing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe possible locations that are available limit where we might be able to source water from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nModern construction is reliant on three core materials those being, wood, concrete, and steel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we get into the specifics of how these materials are made we see that steel and concrete are both composite materials meaning they’re made not grown or harvested.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe modern processes for making these materials make up at least 10.2% of global emissions([https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector)). Yet there are known materials that perform better and are made of industrial waste products. One such material being GGBFS(ground granulated blast furnace slag) a steel industry by-product, or fly ash another blast furnace waste product. After doing lots of research you can then rework construction to take advantage of this fact and the fact that when you use prefabrication as the only means of production you can automate and control the whole process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Housing\n\nZooming out of construction we can now start to talk about housing. The home is the center of most human activity. By focusing our design on making the individual homes of a society as self-sufficient as possible, we can ensure that residents will be fine as well. However, not everyone desire’s the same living conditions as others. Some people prefer to live more communally and some people prefer to live more solitarily. To account for this several different living styles of living should be provided. Below are my proposed styles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Rural: High Concentration\n\nRural high concentration living is a lavish communal living style in which 20–30 people all live in one big mansion. This living-style is based on modern housing cooperatives. Each house would have its own distinct culture, sewage system, and both rooftop garden, and basement marine garden. They’d also be situated each in a permacultural food forest which gradually transitions to a traditional forest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Rural: Low Concentration\n\nRural low concentration is a living style where the community is spread between separate houses that are spaced out quite a bit. Each house is a part of a loose community with neighbors being there but not visible. Think rural Kansas or Michigan. Each house is still surrounded first by a food forest and then that transitions to a natural forest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Urban: Low Concentration\n\nUrban low concentration or suburban is a living style where many small groups of people come together to form a decent-sized community with greater density than that of a rural community.\n\n## Urban: High Concentration\n\nUrban high concentration is a living style where many communities exist is a small space sometimes even right on top of each other. This type of living style is comprised of single-person apartments, all the way to huge urban co-ops. It’s characterized by its diversity, plurality, and busyness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUsing these housing models as a substitute for individuals we can then design our systems with each of these different types of housing in mind. Ensuring that every community has all of the things required for a modern human."

Hi, all, I wanted to share with you this graphic from [Soapbox Project](https://www.soapboxproject.org/archive/what-is-fast-fashion-and-climate-change-sustainability) (weekly bite-sized climate action plans). The graphic is based on this [Business Insider article](https://www.businessinsider.com/fast-fashion-environmental-impact-pollution-emissions-waste-water-2019-10), and more info is below.

There's no way to justify the fashion industry's carbon emissions because we don't even make good use of our clothing.  \n\n* 🚱 The fashion industry is responsible for **20% of all industrial water pollution** worldwide. It's also the second-largest consumer of water — yikes!  \n\n* 🐢 **Over a third of plastic pollution in the ocean comes from microplastics** — much of which comes from washing our clothes. For example, every time we wash our WFH leggings made from polyester (which is made from plastic), a tiny amount ends up in the ocean. That adds up."

lcfvsb,"How I finally got a full-time career in renewables A lot of you were interested in how I got to the point of working full-time on sustainability, and I want to share some steps anyone can take to make sustainability a wider and wider part of their professional journey:\n\n1. Regardless of your major, background, or your current job situation, sustainability can be applied anywhere.  If you are thinking about it and noticing ways things could be improved --congratulations, you are already working on sustainability.\n2. At this stage, it really helps to have a few allies--I guarantee there is at least one other person who has noticed the same problem at your work or school.  they too are thinking to themselves, wow, that's really wasteful and unnecessary; and they too are probably feeling like the only person noticing it.  As hard as it is, the best way to find these fellow sustainability-heroes is to speak up about whatever you've noticed could be improved to be more sustainable.  (This could be a whole post in itself, but the key is to be strategic in when and how you bring it up.  Any area of waste almost always ties to financial waste too, so try to find a way to verbalize it as a potential financial win.  Then it is palatable to almost everyone, and you've also now identified yourself to others who were thinking the same thing from a sustainability standpoint.)\n3. The next step is doing something about it--a change, no matter how small.  Starting this is the hardest step.  I've found once you get things going, you naturally build momentum and confidence that sustainability is something *you* do.  You may also build a handy set of leadership skills in the process.\n4. Finally, rinse and repeat.  Do enough times that you've built the credibility to work on this stuff full-time, if that's what you wish.  And, by the way, there's nothing wrong with integrating this into your life / existing work and never making a big career jump.  We need people who are conscious of waste and sustainability-aware in all walks of life.  This is going to be a huge lift for society, and we need ""lay people"" thinking about it too."
lch7mw,"Dissertation help Hi,\n\nI'm currently doing a masters degree in Quantity Surveying and like the idea of using LCA to assess the the environmental impact of existing materials against sustainable materials in terms of CO2 reductions for my dissertation. I'm writing my proposal now but I'm struggling to find papers that offer relatively simple ways to do it. I understand that LCA is mostly used via software/models but as I'm only comparing specific building elements (i.e. insulation thickness, window type), I was hoping to be able to do it via Excel spreadsheet using a formula.

The US government has promised the land to a copper mining company, Rio Tino, that has already destroyed sacred indigenous sites in Australia.  \n\nCopper mining has major environmental impacts. It results in deforestation, impacts aquifers, pollutes the air with sulphuric acid, contaminates the land and those are all the intended consequences.

Today, we face the possibility that our holy ground will become a giant crater.\nWe condemn the immoral, racist, and unconstitutional seizure and sale of Oak Flat.\nOak Flat is one of the most holy places in the Apache religious tradition, likened to how Christians and Jews regard Mt. Sinai. Resolution Copper's plan would create a crater below Oak Flat two miles wide and 1,000 feet deep.\nThe U.S. Forest Service has moved forward with an environmental impact statement and has refused to consider the Apaches' religious freedom claim, which would stop this destructive mining project. They have declared war on our religion.

You're making sacrifices in your own life to try and help others and the environment, and that is something that needs to be applauded. I hope, if you've faced derision for your lifestyle changes, that you don't let the doomers and non-sustainably minded people get to you. Their approval is irrelevant; take solace in the fact that, should we be successful, then the future generations will look back on us with gratitude and appreciation.

lfyboj,"Advice please: rainwater catching system, dyeing clothes, washing!! Hey there! Asking for some direction or advice here. X posted\n\nI’m starting a small batch clothing business with my friend where we will design, upcycle, dye, print/draw/paint on clothing. We are concerned about water waste, and are also looking to rent a warehouse/studio type space to create in. We’ve started dyeing already, at the moment just at home. Being an eco conscious business we are of course looking to conserve water. I’m interested in implementing a water catching system, a washer, and sink that can use this water, and any tips or advice on how we can possibly do this. \n\nI am completely new to anything regarding this process, but would love to figure out a system that would work for us and do the research. We will be in a warehouse space with several private studios and probably only a shared worksink. Potentially trying to set everything up outside, or have a portable washer or sink that we can bring out to use with the water, or if there’s any possibility to have the sink and washer inside. We definitely need a washer and the sink would be ideal. Also wondering if the rainwater would be good to use or how we can make sure it’s good to use. Also keeping in mind we are in a shared warehouse space that may not have hookups or plugs outside, or even drainage ... like I said I believe there is a work sink in the building or at least one outside.\n\nI know it’s a bit of a complicated subject perhaps, but any suggestions, guides, links, products, reads would be highly appreciated!!

lhazlj,"Why aren't big cities using indoor gardens skyscrapers to reduce cost of social programs and improve air quality in a sustainable way? (LONG) So I ran across something that talked about how grow enough food for a family of four for a year in 550 sq ft indoor gardens. That got me thinking, why don't large cities build large indoor gardens the size of sky scrapers?\n\nNew York City has 274 buildings over 150m tall according to Wikipedia. I'll use the Silver Towers (ranked 99th in height at 199m) for math. On their website, they state it is 1.2 million sq ft in residential and common areas plus 20K in parking. So let's say 1.3M overall. Each tower is 60 stories tall (ignoring how some sections are lower). Total construction cost was $20M. I'm going to use 2016 Public Welfare Financial Condition Report for SNAP information. \n\nSo, New York builds a less than top 100 tallest building modified with as much natural light as possible. They could use white flooring, walls and planter boxes to reflect the light more once inside. You could even give up 10% (random number) of interior sqft-ing to solar panels to increase self sufficiency and sustainability.\n\nEach floor could be climate controlled. That means no seasons on some produce. This plus not having to import some ingredients from other countries or deliver as far, reduces cost to taxpayers. Not importing produce also reduces crime both in the US and the country that produce would have originated from, such as crime associated with the avocado trade in Mexico.\n\nCreate an air circulation system that draws in dirty outside air, filters it through the plants as well as air purifiers built into the system, then it is whisked off to nearby areas of the city through high pressure metal tubing. That system could be augmented with small wind turbines, thus replacing the energy cost of pushing air through the pipes in the first place.\n\nLastly, create a water purification system that uses the city's grey water to water the plants/for toilets/so on plus a rain water collection system on the roof. The soil can filter the water more, which is given back to the city to be filtered AGAIN before reaching people's taps. This reduces impact of farming on water resources while strengthen the safety of city water. Again, you could add water based turbines to generate more alternative energy for the tower.\n\nSo at 60 floors, use one floor as roof, one floor for things like delivery docks, collection chutes from upper floors, and/or employee cafeteria, and another for administrative areas, storage, ect. Random 21,500 (out of \~21,666) sq foot after loss of sq ft to walls. That leaves \~1.225M. Then the 10% loss for solar panels. Finally, desks, walk ways, stairs, elevators, storage of items that don't leave that floor, ect takes up another 10% so 992,655 sq ft of usable area.\n\nAssuming 550 is actually accurate, that would be enough to feed just over 7,200 people a year. That may not sound like much to the 356,350 that are currently on SNAP in New York City. But consider if New York City built 100? That's 36.5% more buildings over 150m but could feed TWICE the number of the people on SNAP with fresh produce. Evenly spaced around the city, that'd be a produce tower every 3 miles or so (based on city area being 302.6 sq mi).\n\nBy providing fresh produce instead of ""cash"" for ANY food item, it ensures greater nutrition for low income children. Because there is fewer funds per SNAP user, it would also lead to less SNAP fraud, and what some consider abuse such as taxpayer's money being used to buy ""luxury"" items such as junk food. In the long run, this also reduces Medicaid costs because they are healthier. Additionally, the tower could be used as a preparation/cooking area for local schools or Meals on Wheels, reducing costs in both those programs while increasing health of individuals in that program.\n\nThen NYC has two options in regards to staffing. Each floor is about half an acre, totaling 28.5 areas per tower. Since every different produce has different needs in number of staffing, I'm going to use 2 per 1/4th acre. It was the one I saw most frequently. Running 100 buildings requires 11,400 farm hands. That wouldn't include jobs created by other areas such as administrative, loading, driving, so on. This could be an alternative to community service or reducing non-heinous crime sentences crimes sentences, thus reducing strain on prisons and tangibly paying off their debt to society. This would be nearly free labor to the city. The other option is city employee staffing, creating safe jobs for New Yorkers, which would also reduce strain on city support by employing people on assistance directly and/or reducing Unemployment related costs.\n\nIf the construction cost matched Silver Towers, that'd be $2B in taxpayer money. Let's say it's split between 10 years, so $200M per year. The link earlier stated 3.8% increase in SNAP lead to $50M more used that year. If 10 towers are built per year, and it saves NYC 4.2% per 10 towers, that is $58.38M. The savings increase exponentially every year.\n\nIn 5 years, they can almost fully cover SNAP recipients with fresh produce. The SNAP program costs NYC $1.39B per year. Very little will need to be given for processed foods, if NYC does not also build a processing areas such as juicing for oranges and apples. They are saving  In another 5, they could cover [Citymeal's](https://www.citymeals.org/about-us/financials) 50,000 homebound elderly and still feed over 300,000 children in NYC schools.\n\nIf they continued that trend, say to a tower per 1.5 miles instead of 3, schools could rely more heavily on these towers to reduce food costs, which could lead to more funds being available for technology upgrades and teacher salary increases. A tower every 1.5 miles would equal 200 towers generating enough produce to feed 1.44M people a year. There are 1.1M students in NYC public schools, meaning it could almost fully cover all SNAP recipients' AND public student meal's produce needs.\n\nI guess TL;DR I believe that large cities should be using skyscraper sized towers to improve the lives of the local community. If NYC built 100- 60 floor buildings specially designed to allow natural light to produce fresh, local produce, I believe it would lead to higher quality of living by improving air and water quality, reducing crime, improving education, creating jobs, increasing access to &amp; the consumption of produce, and increasing average health while also freeing up funds to assist other programs (such as creating a free feminine hygiene product program), reducing reliance on fossil fuels, reducing water pollution caused by farming and reducing the amount of flat land needed for produce farming.  \n\n\nEdit: Some of the links immediately didn't work. Sorry about that!"

Hi all!\n\nI know plant-based natural fibres are best (like cotton and bamboo) but the other day I was shopping for period pants and was offered the option of vegan for a little more money. I figured vegan would be more sustainable, so I chose that. I can only assume the “standard” kind contain wool products. However, after my purchase it occurs to me that the vegan version probably contain synthetic fibres that might shed and contribute to microplastics.\n\nI’m not really looking for an answer here because I don’t think it’s possible to obtain sufficient information to make an informed choice, but just a discussion point."

In those moments, I don't give a shit about the environment, I'm wasteful, I don't shop consciously, I eat unhealthy, etc.\n\nWhen I slow down, when I become more mindful of the body and my surrounding environment, when I take time to breathe and be aware of the present moment, I find I naturally make more environmentally conscious decisions. It's not an effort, it's easeful and joyful. I'm not longer trying to fill a void within myself through consumerism. \n\nAll of the technological innovations are fantastic for creating a more sustainable society but without a shift in our mental habits, without becoming more aware and mindful, we'll continue down the same path of environmental destruction. \n\nMaybe this is already obvious to most people but it feels important for me to reflect on and writing helps me process these things. \n\nThanks or reading."

Rethink?\n\nThere are few, if any, areas of life unaffected by COVID-19. Terms including social distancing, PPE and flattening the curve form part of our everyday conversation. We are necessarily denying our most basic human need to be close and connected to one another because of a virus that forces us physically apart. Irony aside, a worldwide pandemic has brought humanity together into a state of shared experience on a level unlike any in history.\n\nIn America the lights shone and the water ran; the delivery trucks still rolled. Do we emerge from this nightmare with a sense of triumph, unapologetically returning to the ways of the past? Or do we proceed with the recognition that a world apparently too big to fail sits on an untenably fragile foundation? \n\nThe pandemic is a clarion call that lets us shake off institutional dust that may have settled over time. An unbiased (to the extent possible), open and label-free confrontation of our past is our chance for growth—a true rethink.\n\nAt the root of why, with this virus, it is different this time, is a borderless world much more tightly interconnected by trade and travel than it was during the 1918 flu pandemic. Such interconnectedness will work to our advantage if we let it. If we reflect, and turn that reflection into action, we will reach a deeper meaning to this unprecedented global experience.\n\nSo how do we make the most of this transition?\n\n2.	Ask ‘Why?’ \n\nRather than spouting a list of societal ills, we can examine root causes. The limits and structures of the biological, anthropological and technological realms that so dictate the form of our commerce and development are not fixed, and the outcomes we took for granted are ripe for change. As business reward systems squeezed the last cent out of the marginal customer’s pocket, few of us questioned them, and even fewer of us had the means to offer alternatives. The forces at work were bigger than us. Coordinated, collaborative economic models found no oxygen.\n\nAfter all, humanity was forged in the same fiery crucible as all life on earth. Consider competition and the law of the jungle: a lion must be the biggest and most savage to ward off rival lions. This winning survival strategy applies to germs, plants, animals and humans. Indeed, the free market and conventional capitalist systems are patterned on it. Over a billion people were lifted out of extreme poverty under this regime over the last thirty years^(1).  Such a rising tide lifted all boats, and we need not minimize its positive effects.\n\n3.	So what?\n\nStill, the rising tide has been anything but uniform. The majority of US earnings growth accrued to the top 20 percent of earners^(2)  and large corporate interests in the last fifty years. Ordinary, hardworking people were left in a very distant second tier. The structural barriers that deny upward mobility kept quality of life nearly stagnant over the same term for the middle and lower classes. This lack of earnings growth has been estimated to equal $2.5 trillion a year, $47 trillion since 1975^(3). \n\nAnd why? The short answer, the law of the jungle, dictates that those who hold power hoard power, be it Wall Street bankers, heirs and heiresses to generational fortunes, or corrupt officials. We can observe the historical thread of hoarding, starting with tribal warlords, to monarchs, to the nobility and aristocracy, to the robber barons building the industrialized world, and finally to the utter intoxication of participants in capital markets and government. We also observe little meaningful change to power dynamics along the way.\n\nIn the US, layering a democratic government over a free market solves for some of conventional capitalism’s side effects, but perverse incentives are nevertheless cross-pollinated between politics and big business. Furthermore, a constrained government lacks the resources for overwhelming success, and so the bureaucratic class does a poor job with most tasks.\n\nMeanwhile, power hoarders have their thumb on the scale, armed as they are with ruthlessness and a focus on distributive outcomes^(4).  America may be the poster child, but this holds true for basically every place one can think of.\n\nIn 2018, the 26 wealthiest people held the same wealth as the bottom 50% of all humanity (3.8 billion people). In 2017 it was the top 43, in 2016 it was the top 61^(5). \n\n4.	An emerging downside\n\nWhere does the status quo lead? A system so inherently and so passionately rivalrous works ‘great’ in yesterday’s world, with a billion people, or two billion people, or perhaps even five billion people—not so much at eight billion. Humanity is bumping up against the carrying capacity of earth’s gifts, with its hand on a tinderbox of social tensions ready to blaze. We are all connected; dire consequences from the next Black Swan event, no matter how far away its geographical origin, will not leave us undamaged.\n\nHardly a path to survival, the status quo in the real world of environmental resource constraints and outsized social power imbalances looks like an extremely bad bet. If we are not yet careening off a Thelma-&amp;-Louise-style cliff at 100 mph, we’re only a thousand yards away going a good 45 mph. Neither braking nor steering away is an option. We must disassemble, re-engineer, and rebuild that Thunderbird convertible and take to the skies before reaching the precipice. Environmental and social tipping points are real, and we need to be planning for the consequences of crossing our first. We are lucky it didn’t come from this virus. Our addiction to some form of capitalism has been millennia in the making, and the institutional inertia is too great to ignore for one more instant.\n\nThe question of whether we can escape the forces that defined our past is existential, and the answer, therefore, binds our very future.\n\n5.	Coordinates of the solution(s)\n\nDoes answering the question require entirely new technologies, or can we simply make use of existing technologies in novel ways? What features of existing systems—especially conventional capitalism—can be incorporated into a new and improved system with little disruption to the old and tired way of doing things? What tweaks allow for a stable evolution rather than a violent revolution?\n\nShould such adjustments be available, then superior paths forward reveal themselves absent the attachment to any form of politics, economics or ideology. Taking this one step further: how can the best features of established systems coexist while locking out their worst features and consequences?\n\n6.	The silo of low-hanging fruit\n\nWe may well strive for wholesale changes in the laws of the land, the roll call of our political representatives, social justice, the economy, or in our collective relationship to the natural world. Balancing our aims with what is realistic, and with what will move the needle, guides our direction.\n\nWhile all societal silos^(6)  are probably ripe for a refresh, the focus of this document is commerce and economics. As important as the ballot box, economic participation is a weapon the individual can wield on a daily basis. Whereas political elections take place once every two years, we can vote with our wallet each and every day, and the effects are cumulative.\n\nWe are not, however, taking this weapon up in a meaningful way. The low-hanging fruit for effecting change is described by the primary pillar of Sustainablism: a sustainable business organization (SBO).\n\n7.	Sustainable Business Organization (SBO)\n\nHow businesses are organized dictates how business is done as a system (see Appendix I). The impact of these choices is profound. These are the four defining organizational principles required by Sustainablist firms:\n\ni)	50% employee ownership, 50% customer ownership\n\nii)	equitably minded governance\n\niii)	hyper-transparency \n\niv)	externality^(7)  recapture\n\n(See Appendix II for brief explanations of the principles.)\n\n8.	The SBO footprint\n\nAny industry may contain SBOs, but Sustainablist entrepreneurs should endeavor to create a robust ecosystem of SBOs in the following sectors:\n\ni)	agribusiness\n\nii)	water supply &amp; sanitation\n\niii)	apparel\n\niv)	housing &amp; construction\n\nv)	energy supply\n\nvi)	education\n\nvii)	health care\n\nviii)	transportation &amp; mobility\n\nix)	communications\n\nSelf-determined, democratic control over these sectors is the basic outcome targeted by Sustainablism. Universally high-quality access to these resources should be seen as a prerequisite for a high-functioning, Sustainablist society. Given our daily transactions in these domains, we are overlooking almost all of our opportunity to vote for meaningful upward mobility or other forms of change.\n\n9.	Features and consequences of SBOs\n\nBroadly, SBO entrepreneurs work toward three outcomes:\n\ni)	levelling the socioeconomic playing field (rising tides lift all boats equitably)\n\nii)	establishing superior economic equilibria^(8)  and outcomes\n\niii)	reducing the work of government\n\nAll four of the SBO organizational principles from section 7 play a role in achieving these outcomes, but a special focus on superior economic equilibria (see Appendix III and this section) makes the strongest case.\n\nTo explore what is different in an SBO ecosystem, we have to understand the status quo (see Appendix IV), namely that the basic stock and trade of power hoarders is asymmetric information^(9),  the fungibility of power^(10),  and differential advantage^(11).  These are the thumb-on- the-scale effects that result in errors in the attribution of profit—and, ultimately, inequity.\n\nProfit is a crucial component of SBO transactions, and it is attributed to a firm’s individual owners just as in conventional capitalism. The traditionally accepted view of capitalism is that the pursuit of profit should be the primary goal of the firm. This need not change under Sustainablism. Obviously, should the owners of a firm wish to keep realizing this profit, then decisions that would lead to the collapse of the firm must be avoided. Although there are many decisions to be made for a working SBO, the most important for our immediate discussion relates to setting the market clearing price^(12)  on any good or service.\n\nLet us compare price-setting under conventional capitalism and Sustainablism. Under the former, no firm will:\n\n•	increase prices beyond the point where customers are willing to purchase the good or service produced by the firm: no willingness to pay = no sales = no firm = no profit for the owners\n\n•	decrease prices beyond the point the firm can cover the cost of producing the good or service: no means of production = no sales = no firm = no profit for the owners^(13)  \n\nFirms naturally seek the highest possible price for their goods and services, and customers seek the lowest possible price. This tension is settled by the free market and the forces of supply and demand.\n\nIn contrast, Sustainablism establishes or assumes the following to achieve equilibrium:\n\n•	firms are composed of employees (specifically, the managerial class^(14)) who set the prices of their goods and services\n\n•	sales are executed with customers, who accept the sales price\n\n•	this setting and acceptance of prices is required for a transaction to take place\n\n•	transactions create profits for owners\n\n•	owners want continuing profits\n\n•	because owners want continuing profits, they will make decisions that ensure the long-term life of the firm (rather than its destruction)\n\n•	Sustainablist firms are 50:50 owned by employees and customers\n\n•	Because ownership of Sustainablist firms is held equally by employees and customers, they must therefore fairly resolve any underlying tensions to set prices so that transactions can take place for themselves, as owners, to realize profit\n\nUnder the SBO framework, every transaction involves owners seeking fairness and long-term sustainability. The effect cascades up and down the supply chain because the sellers of goods and services to end consumers are indeed customers themselves (and therefore owners) of their suppliers^(15).  Instead of fighting over 100 percent ‘ownership’ of one side of every transaction, an assemblage of SBO firms effectively becomes 50 percent owners of all sides of every transaction in a given supply chain, with consumption restricted to the goods and services customers actually want to buy, as profit-seeking owners.\n\nOwnership is by far the most important path to wealth and is therefore the most important means of levelling the socioeconomic playing field. Furthermore, with ownership supercharging agency, Sustainablist outcomes flowing from the bottom up gain more traction.\n\nNone of this requires the necessary government interventions found in conventional capitalism, nor the central command found in real-world applications of communism (these systems are two sides of the same law-of-the-jungle coin). Nothing conceptual should prevent us from having the same economy under Sustainablism as we do today. If producing a 99¢ hamburger involves cutting down the Brazilian rainforest for grazing and paying burger flippers near poverty wages, and if all economic actors, including customers, workers and resource suppliers, collectively decide^(16)  that what matters is producing that 99¢ hamburger, then that is what we get under Sustainablism. Hyper-transparency requires us to do this with our eyes open, externality recapture assigns a dollar cost to repairing the rainforest, and 50:50 ownership makes paying a living wage a necessity (otherwise we fail to attract any employees). While our Sustainablist stipulations mean we might not have a 99¢ hamburger anymore, whatever arrangements or product we are left with—a pricier, healthier foodstuff or a healthier food-supply chain—will, by definition, increase to the stock of society’s profit.\n\nThe superior outcomes resulting from superior equilibria drives economic efficiencies and fosters a mindset of coordination. The pursuit of profit under Sustainablism is a unifying force rather than a rivalrous one.\n\nBecause consumers, firms and resource suppliers—all economic actors in a Sustainablist framework—make decisions based on self-interest and against self-harm, government expenditure on legislating, regulating or policing corporate activity is meaningfully reduced. By relying on corporations that actually self-regulate with integrity, Sustainablism leads to smaller government while affording the free market leeway to solve our challenges in a coordinated fashion. Sustainablism’s end game, if you will, sees government focused on foreign relations^(17),  the military, large public works and taxation.\n\nSustainablism’s simple, natural efficiencies of less regulation and inherent cooperation achieve positive change without a forced redistribution of wealth away from power hoarders in the form of higher taxes. Sustainablism moves the invisible hand of the free market, wherever it hovers over the dark side, into the light.\n\nThe 50:50 ownership structure stipulated for SBOs is crucial for true long-term sustainability. Equilibrium is balance; any tilt towards one party introduces a drifting force and an eventual reversion to something that looks much like the status quo. Furthermore, the 50:50 structure leads to a positive blurring of the lines of the firm as individual links in supply chains coordinate more and more to produce the best goods and services possible. As the ethos of Sustainablism achieves a meaningful hold on market participants, new entrants may propose alternate ownership structures, but the reader is cautioned that these may amount to a fatal flaw^(18)  and could be the mark of mere virtue-signallers.\n\nFor Sustainablism to take hold, consumers will have to vote with their wallets in favor of SBOs. Amenable voters would number in the hundreds of millions, and they should be easy to activate in this particular moment of our history.\n\nTo the extent the ideas in this paper resonate, readers need to act to create this demand. If the clawing of power hoarders at the walls of democracy disgusts you, strongly consider your creative role by supporting emerging Sustainablist businesses. Power hoarders don’t yet realize that the bricks they tear down are the same which fortify their vaults.\n\n10.	So, how?\n\nThere are only three fundamental problems that need to be solved before Sustainablism can gain a meaningful foothold in the real economy:\n\ni)	the resource problem;\n\nii)	the technology problem; and\n\niii)	the coordination problem\n\nWe are very fortunate to be living in an age—for now—when we have yet to cross the line marking a general availability of resources. Society needs to act well before this changes.\n\nThe technology problem^(19)  is a matter of combining existing solutions rather than one of invention. It can be solved, likely within twelve months, given sufficient resources. Conveniently, this is probably around the same amount of time it will take to fully transition out of a COVID world.\n\nThis leaves the coordination problem. The plan for answering that can be found at [https://dunbarscafe.com/](https://dunbarscafe.com/the_plan_and_next_steps.php).\n\n11.	Common criticisms\n\nThis is naïve and idealistic\n\nThis is optimistic—and there is a massive difference. Whether we experience an economic recession or expansion, it is nothing more than a self-fulfilling prophecy. When people are generally optimistic about their circumstances, they work and spend and the economy grows. When people are generally pessimistic, they cut back on spending, some lose their jobs and the economy shrinks. It really is as simple as that, and we need not shy away from this linkage. We should be leaning into this property and applying it to other areas of commerce. At its core, the establishment of Sustainablism represents the weaponization of optimism in a parallel economy. If people are made aware of Sustainablism and are conceptually tuned to demand the goods and services offered by SBOs, SBOs will form and fill this need^(20). \n\nSustainablism doesn’t require everyone’s optimism to be feasible; pessimists will remain in the larger, original system for some time. If Sustainablism is to become the dominant system, however, it does require the optimists to outcompete the pessimists. Within the fundamentally cooperative infrastructure set by SBOs, and with a levelling of the playing field that results, this should prove eminently workable.\n\nMeanwhile, pessimists will convert to optimism in a virtuous cycle. Why? Pessimists aren’t really pessimists, they just don’t see another way. Optimists need to start showing them one, and there are certainly enough of us out there. In other words, once we hit Sustainablist critical mass, it will trigger a positive social tipping point.\n\nThis is communism/socialism\n\nEvery communist and socialist society submits to the heavy hand of central planning, bloated bureaucracies, public ownership and power hoarding that characterizes conventional capitalism. This is in opposition to what is described by Sustainablism.\n\nUnlike communism, Sustainablism is not in conflict with conventional capitalism in any way whatsoever. Indeed, it is a form of capitalism and uses the same levers—no revolution required. With a bit of insight we can ‘hack’ our economy and change the status quo and its consequences.\n\nThe Sustainablist system relies on individual choice and private ownership to direct the economy. The profit from transactions is not directed to the single commons of socialism^(21);  rather, people direct their transactions to a commons that they themselves define, own and control. In other words, those that create profit decide where that value goes. Sustainablism is the most democratic and freedom-aligned way of organizing economic infrastructure.\n\nThis will stifle innovation\n\nIf the ownership share of entrepreneurs, as the founders of SBO firms, is reduced as it is shared with employees and customers, will they have the incentive to innovate in the first place? Firstly, money’s role as a motivator is overestimated when the fate of the planet is at stake, especially for millennials and Generation Z. Secondly, founders can still command very high compensation through their salaries. Finally, the initial ecosystem of SBOs will be focused on rolling out and scaling up existing technology in food, housing, and energy to consumers rather than creating new technologies. There is plenty of incentive for the  development of new technologies within the status quo of concentrated founder ownership, venture capital, and institutional investment in IPOs. A transitional stage may last decades, and we will not likely see innovative, high-risk startups organized as SBOs until a new generation of entrepreneurs is born into a Sustainablist economic system.\n\nThis off-ramp of sorts puts society into two classes: the innovative class, which develops new technology under the status quo, and the virtuous class, which scales existing technology using SBOs. These labels are for convenience only and are not meant to be mutually exclusive; the innovative class needs to be virtuous and the virtuous class needs to be innovative.\n\n12.	Conclusion \n\nSustainablism is a centrist approach to economic thought,  the design of which should appeal to everyone across the political spectrum. It encompasses the ideals of universal access to food, shelter and the like while clinging tightly to the free market, private ownership and the maintenance of a class system. It is capitalist with respect to rules and processes and socially conscious with respect to outcomes.\n\nBusiness can no longer afford to look the other way; stakeholders increasingly demand that commercial enterprise align with their values. The four organizational principles of SBOs guarantees this alignment across different supply chains and through the economy. Sustainablism requires no new technologies, and it incorporates some of the best features of existing economic systems while locking out their worst features.\n\nIn a free market system where competition ensures that humanity is always in its best age in the present moment, it is naïve to assume that there is no room for improvement. If the availability of the latest and greatest &lt;insert your favorite product here&gt; is a result of efficient competition between the elements within a system, what healthy outcomes arise from competition between parallel systems? Add the field of business organization to the list of those undergoing a restructuring in 2021.\n\nWhile Sustainablism may not prove to be the answer, it is a very good candidate as a starting point. This paper is meant to jumpstart us into actually living the search for a new way of doing things and not just having a conversation about it. ‘Innovate or die’ never rang more true than it does today.\n\nAs we look toward a world without COVID-19, we ask: What world do we want to emerge into? How will we reconnect with each other? What will future generations say about what we made out of these circumstances and our legacy? Will the human world ultimately be one of stewardship and balance? Or will it be one of ruin? If your answer is the same as mine, let’s make the world a better place together.\n\n[https://dunbarscafe.com](https://dunbarscafe.com/the_plan_and_next_steps.php) \n\nPlease see [Dunbar's Cafe](https://dunbarscafe.com/The_Sustainablist_Masnifesto.pdf) for footnotes and appendices"

Especially since I’m in college with a major in architecture and a minor in sustainability (I wanna be in firms that focus on creating sustainable and self sustaining (power) buildings).\n\nEither way every time I’m asked why I’m so passionate about it I get flustered.\n\nI’m passionate about it because it’s essential to our current environmental status. Not only that but sustainability is part of everything. All majors, all life aspects. Down to how you choose your veggies to how you decide to get to work or why the education system is failing or Texas freezing over. Because of the complex systems in sustainability it’s interested itself into our everyday lives. One wouldn’t even need to think too hard about it at times since some of the biggest solutions are so simple and straightforward.\n\nBut now I wanna hear other people. Why are you so passionate about sustainability, what makes you so passionate to join a Reddit, read articles and grasping any knowledge about it???"

Not sad that the climate is failing - I truly believe action will be exponential - sad that people have such a pessimistic outlook on the situation. Here we live in the golden age of everything except the climate, and we - our generations - have the chance to literally save *an entire planet*. The opportunities to completely redesign Earth into a cyclical, sustainable world is upon us.\n\nNo, I don’t have any delusions. There will be tragedy. Loss of species. Natural disasters increasing. But by the end - and if we stay below around 2.3 ( which is around my prediction at this point - hopefully to lower soon) - the world will remain liveable. \n\nI encourage anyone to comment with agreement or lack thereof!"

An example being Sinclair Meadows in the UK, the first street to be 'carbon negative' in the UK.

The residents could all be eating heavy red-meat diets or not shopping locally and totally wipe out any gains made elsewhere.\n\nThe vision I'm looking to create is something where absolutely every consideration, from the physical materials, services, lifestyles, diet, education etc is all pulling in the same direction, and therefore becomes truly 'sustainable' and zero-impact.\n\nI would love your input into this system idea, absolutely anything you can offer positive or negative is welcome and appreciated.\n\nSome prompts for you to think about could be:\n\n* perceived relative advantage – over existing systems\n* ease of use – of any tangible elements including ergonomic and anthropometric detail of physical and psychological fit\n* perceived compatibility – with existing products, services and systems\n* perceived value – whether the potential value of a new system is readily seen\n* cultural acceptance – whether the system is acceptable to potential users and personnel involved in its delivery\n\nThanks to anyone who engages in advance!"

My team and I are working on developing an online point-based fashion trading platform, SwagSwap. We’ve always thought of clothes and accessories as a way people can express themselves. It’s away for people to let their unique personality shine through. However, this doesn’t deter from the fact that fast fashion is a huge problem in today’s world. Since you guys support sustainability, we thought we could ask for your support. In our world today, the average person throws around 70 pounds of clothing per year- this leads to more than 13,000,000 tons of textile waste globally, 95% of which can be reused. That's where SwagSwap comes in. By establishing a sustainable, interdependent cycle, we ensure that your gently used clothes get a chance at another life. And here's the best part- it's all point based! Upload your item to the site with a selling price (in points), and when it is bought, use the points to shop for new items! Don't worry- if your clothes don't sell, you have the option of sending it to a sustainable artist (so they can turn your clothes into cool merchandise, or as we like to call it, swag ;), and get reimbursed with 75% of the original point price! This all sounds cool, right? But here's the thing. We need your help- we have entered the Blue Ocean Entrepreneurship Competition, and we would love to win! The prize money would go towards funding for our site. We have already entered two other competitions and are currently competing as finalists. In order to support us and help us win the People's Choice Award, please click the Youtube link below and like our video. Thank you for your time, and we hope to see you on our site very, very soon!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXUKc4QxD3Y&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXUKc4QxD3Y&amp;feature=youtu.be)"

I think that carbon pricing will make it easier to cut through green washing and make it easier to figure out less polluting choices without having to do some sort of complex lifecycle analyses for every purchase. (ie is it better to hold onto a gas guzzling car that is in good shape or buy a new more efficient electric vehicle with all of the attendant emissions of making a new car. Is there any point in buying a new electric car if your electricity is still coming 50% from fossil fuels.).

If it was a country, it'd be in the top 30 energy users. **Note:** if you disagree with anything in here, please link me to the appropriate source. I am NOT a bitcoin expert; just trying to make this info easier to understand for people like me just trying to learn more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here is the full write-up](https://www.soapboxproject.org/archive/the-planetary-impacts-of-bitcoin-climate-change) with sources linked.\n\n \n\n**What the heck is Bitcoin?**\n\nBitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency. Here's a [**cryptocurrency explainer for kids**](https://www.kidsnews.com.au/money/what-is-cryptocurrency-and-how-does-it-work-in-the-digital-world/news-story/7f8105dbed5eb13916b379fab8b6c437) (I needed it), but the basic idea is that it's a secure, verifiable, digital alternative to cash money.\n\nAll you need to know for today is that the ""verifiable"" part of crypto is what makes it relevant to sustainability.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Why does it matter to climate change?**\n\nYou acquire Bitcoin by ""mining"" it digitally. Let's use gold as an example — gold miners had to expend time, money, and energy to find and extract hidden nuggets.  \n\n\nNow lets imagine that the tools used to mine and verify the legitimacy of the gold consumed more power than your house, and the more gold you mined, the harder your miners had to work, and the more energy they consumed.  \n\n\nBitcoin matters to climate change because it consumes a huge amount of energy, and the energy per transaction will continue to increase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n**How bad is it, really?**\n\nFrom the sources above and a few more linked, here are some quick facts:\n\n* A single Bitcoin transaction expends enough electricity to power the average US home for three weeks ([**The Phoenix**](https://thephoenix.substack.com/p/tuesday-thread-air-travel-bitcoin/comments)/[**Digiconomist**](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/))  \n\n* In Iceland more energy is likely used mining Bitcoin than for combined household use ([**Fortune**](https://fortune.com/2018/02/13/iceland-bitcoin-mining-electricity/))  \n\n* Most electricity used to mine Bitcoin comes from fossil fuels, Bitcoin produces 37 million tons of carbon dioxide annually (same as the country of Switzerland) ([**The Phoenix**](https://thephoenix.substack.com/p/bitcoin-is-now-worth-50000-and-its))  \n\n* If Bitcoin was a country, it would be in the top 30 energy users. It's exceeded Argentina - yikes  \n\n* The top 0.01% holders of Bitcoin have 22x the combined Bitcoins as all the rest of us combined — it could be a bad income inequality multiplier ([**Eric Holthaus &amp; Bitinfocharts**](https://twitter.com/EricHolthaus/status/1363134206671532033))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4lcqa30yyvk61.png?width=4320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72abc97e7ea92289000d20d630fee8f5233c11b6\n\n \n\n**Is it all bad?**\n\nI'm honestly still grappling with this, but the most compelling argument in favor of Bitcoin is that people want to make money off of it, existing energy is too expensive, so it incentivizes the production of solar energy. I'll share sources when I find something more credible than [**blog posts**](https://medium.com/@philgeiger/bitcoin-is-good-for-the-environment-fc5ff7448b9e).  \n\n\nMy take (for now) is that Bitcoin is net negative, but there are so many other types of cryptocurrency like [**Ethereum**](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/vision/) acknowledging the planetary impacts of crypto technology and surfacing solutions. I need to learn more about why people are obsessed with Bitcoin and only Bitcoin when it seems like there are ""better"" cryptos out there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease chime in (kindly and with sources, don't be a jerk) if you have anything to add or oppose! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis write-up has been taken from [Soapbox Project.](https://www.soapboxproject.org/archive/the-planetary-impacts-of-bitcoin-climate-change)"

m0jos6,"Tips to be sustainable in college I’m a current college sophomore with an interest in environmental sustainability. I actually find it slightly harder to be sustainable in college as you don’t get to choose a lot of sustainable options. But here is what I’ve discovered \n\n1. Re-useable coffee cup \nThis one is one of the easiest things you can do and actually saves you money. For every 10 times I used my reusable cup at Starbucks last year, I would get a free pastry so score. I only actually used five plastic coffee cups last year, all five of which were handed to me by friends who wanted to do something nice (but just forgot to use my cup). During the pandemic, this isn’t as possible unfortunately. Nowadays I bring my reusable straw everywhere so I don’t use any plastic straws, so at least that’s something. \n\n2. Tablet note taking \nThis one blows peoples minds, but I’m serious. Using a tablet for note taking instead of paper is actually more sustainable. The carbon footprint of a whole day’s charge of an iPad is the same as a single sheet of paper. Apple is also really good at recycling older devices to get new parts to produce their new devices. A way to reduce the price of a tablet is to get one one generation behind. You can get huge discounts this way; I know Apple sells older iPads for $300 less than they used to retail at. And getting one refurbished is great as you didn’t create demand for new materials as much as you would buying a completely new device. \n\n3. Walk &gt; The Bus &gt; Uber/Own Car \nWalk wherever you can. Whenever it’s March-November at my university I walk to college town whenever my friends and I go out. But if you have to take a vehicle somewhere, take the bus. Your weight being on the bus technically creates more gas consumption, but that’s better than using a vehicle of you own somewhere. Also taking the bus at my university is free, so I’d much rather take that than an Uber or Lyft somewhere."

m2b3vf,"Looking for advice in choosing to repair or purchase a new smartphone I try to make ethical decisions when buying electronics. I usually buy refurbished products as to try to contribute to planned obsolescence as little as possible, but unfortunately they don't seem to last as long. Still, buying and then selling products when they break, albeit more regularly than with newer products, feels like a better choice than just buying a new phone outright. Unfortunately my Samsung galaxy S8 had problems immediately. The battery expanded and so I was forced to take the case off until I could get it switched, then dropped it. Without a case to protect it the phone got cracked. Back, front, and LED screen. LED alone is going to be $230, I think all in all it will be about $300-400 to get repaired, much more than the phone is worth. I could \*probably\* replace the glass front and back myself, but that concerns me a bit, and delaying the repair process would suck because I am job hunting and it would delay my time without a much needed cell phone. \n\n  \nSo, my question is, would it be unethical to sell this one and then buy a new one? It just seems much cheaper to get a new one. I don't want to be wasteful, but I think if I sell it someone will repair and sell it so its not as if I am just tossing it. If I go that route, should I go for another refurb, in order to minimize waste, or get a new one in hopes that if I take good care of the next one I could possibly get it to last longer? If I do go for another phone, any recommendations on the most ethical products? I distinctly remember buying the Galaxy s8 because I thought the materials were more ethically sourced than it's competitors, but now I cant find whatever article led me to believe that in the first place. I would like a pixel because of the camera, but still need to look into those more. I live in the US, so fairphone is unfortunately not an option. Thanks in advance!"

m3gbdv,Peak sustainability  
m3gdnj,"Barriers to Change in Agriculture  A large number of posts on this sub are relating to food production. Possibly disproportionately so to other sectors, but that's okay. It's a great topic for people to engage on, we all make daily choices about food and have at least some understanding of it's production. I work as a researcher in this area and it really is great to see the engagement.\n\nI wanted to talk a bit about barriers to change in agriculture. It's an incredibly tough industry to change compared to many others.\n\nMy experience is predominantly in the UK livestock sector as a researcher in animal health/welfare and sustainability/environmental mitigatin. This may be slightly contexualised in that way, though much of it will apply more widely. I have worked on other topics though (wheat production in China, consequences of deforestation in Malaysia etc).\n\nOf course this does not cover everything. There are also exceptions and theories to address these things. These aren't necessarily my views, but simply factors that are important in this area. I'm not here to specifcially critique or criticise anything in particular or to be pro/anti anything. I just wanted to give food for thought for when we are all discussing agriculture.\n\n**Farming consists of lots of small businesses**\n\nIf you want to make a change in the automotive industry, that change applies across a small number of huge players. In agriculture it's the opposite, you have a huge number of small players. Thousands and thousands of farms. This makes change very difficult to implement and, if legislative, difficult to monitor.\n\n**Apples and oranges**\n\nLegislation itself is very diffiult. Two factories can be compared like-to-like as they're entirely artificial constructs. Two farms cannot. They have different soil, climate, slope aspect, local fauna and flora etc. It's incredibly difficult to compare one farm to another. There's a lot of talk about benchmarking farms for efficiency, but it's near impossible to do. Legislation, by it's very nature, is broad. Broad policies don't work well in farming due to how unique each farm is.\n\np.s. for those who do not know the phrase ""Comparing apples and oranges"" is a phrase that means comparing two things that are not alike enough to make a valid comparision.\n\n**Farms are family businesses**\n\nIn terms of land-use. It's difficult from a social perspective to change. If you grew up on the farm with your grandparents rearing cattle and now its in your hands, it's natural to want to continue that tradition.\n\nThis also creates an issue for policy. If you make a policy in industry and a business collapses because they don't adapt or follow the rules, then it can be seen as progress and market forces. In agriculture it's not some anonymous business that collapses. It's a family, who live on the farm and whose entire lives revolve around it. This also means the topic is very much in the heart of many people involved in agriculture.\n\n**Capital and liquidity**\n\nChange costs. In most countries farmers are relatively poor. Those that are rich are usually asset rich, capital poor. e.g. there net-worth is tied up in land and machinery and they have little money in the bank. This makes upgrading systems very difficult. \n\nFurthermore, it makes risk difficult to manage. If you change a system that's worked and your experiment fails, then you are in big trouble financially. I saw this a lot in China. Farmers would knowingly use far too much fertiliser. Doing so guaranteed them about 90% of their maximum possible yields. If they tried to be accurate aiming for 100% of their potential yield, and undercalculated, they might only hit 70-80%.\n\nFinally, in many developing nations, rural households live week to week. They simply can't afford to implement long-term strategies if there is a short-term loss to food and economic security.\n\n**Profitting from assets**\n\nFor many farmers, their assets (land) are their primary source of security. They therefore need to use that to create income. In some areas, you have choice in how you do this (e.g. which crop). In others, you have far less choice - Some land isn't suitable for arrable crops and therefore pasture for grazing is the logical economic step for the land owner. Essentially, the value of that land is driven by its agricultural capabilities and returns.\n\nOf course, we talk about rewilding such areas, but so long as it is under private ownership, the owner can't be expected to do that if it returns no financial rewards. If you make the livestock production less profitable (e.g. change subsidies) we then hit this next hurdle:\n\n**Votes**\n\nRural voters are hugely important in most countires. Usually because rural areas are large so you end up with a lot of constituencies/districts covered by rural communities, despite relatively small populations. This means that winning rural votes is often key to power. Therefore, there is a reluctancy to introduce radical farming policies that could be received negatively."

m3m8kf,"Environmental economics discussing population as a problem My course in environmental economics has been discussing population as a problem. We have spent time discussing population limits and ways to lower population, but briefly came to the conclusion that there is nothing we can do to stop people from having children. I’m not sure if that lesson was impactful enough because we never discussed any real complex problems. We were basically discussing eugenics, but never called it that. I doubt my professor wants to demonize this topic, but I am more... focused on ethics and social justice from my own studies so this is a concern for me.\n\nAlthough from an economics stand point these courses are focused on capitalism and to keep the economy going we need constant resources to extract according to demand. Through this simple notion population instinctually is the problem if we want to protect resources. \n\nThis course while not focused on ethics has a larger ethics problem in my eyes. Honestly I feel like this lesson very I outdated and misleading but this could just be the nature of economic courses. \n\nIt just seems small brain. (._.)"

m3pqx1,"3 Simple Tips On How To Reduce Your Carbon Footprint Did you know that carbon dioxide levels are 40% higher than they were in pre-industrial times?\n\nGlobal warming is the biggest threat facing humanity. Scientists are agreed that the planet is warming due to human activity and we must act to prevent irreversible damage.\n\nIf we fail to act now, we'll all be negatively affected by higher temperatures and rising sea levels. Some parts of the world will also become uninhabitable.\n\nBut, we can still prevent this if we all act now.\n\n## 1. Change Your Diet\n\nBefore you do anything, we recommend [calculating your carbon footprint](https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/). In order to reduce global warming, it's recommended we all have a carbon footprint of 1.87 tons.\n\nThe U.S. per capita carbon footprint is 18.3 tons, so there's a long way to go for most of us.\n\nCalculating it will also help show you how much carbon and money you're saving.\n\nIn terms of food, you should focus on a low meat and dairy diet. Livestock- meat and dairy is a huge cause of global carbon emissions and other greenhouse gases.\n\nLivestock also produces high amounts of methane that's far worse at trapping heat inside the atmosphere. Over the past half-century, meat and dairy consumption have increased dramatically which has accelerated global warming.\n\nOne of the reasons is fast-food chains conquering the globe and offering low-priced meat and dairy products.\n\nIn order to help, you should eat far more fruits, vegetables, grains, and beans. The carbon emissions to produce these foods are far lower thus, it helps the environment.\n\nBut don't panic if you're not a Michelin star chef as there are lots of [veggie/vegan recipes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hlAQBmtkRk&amp;t=479s) out there that are both tasty and healthy.\n\n## 2. Avoid Fast Fashion\n\nNew trends and styles result in people throwing away clothes after a short while. Most clothes then go to landfill sites where they produce methane as they decompose.\n\nTo prevent this and help the environment you should look to buy [recycled clothes](https://happygrapestore.com/product/womens-reemill-u00ae-recycled-t-shirt/). This is where the materials from old clothes have been reused to make a new product.\n\nT-shirts, jumpers, hats, and more can be recycled many times. This reduces the number of landfills thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAlso, look to buy [clothes made from organic cotton](https://happygrapestore.com/collection/womens-t--shirts/). Being organic means that no harmful pesticides have been used to produce it. Pesticides often harm the local environment by contaminating nearby rivers and lakes.\n\nRead the full article [here](https://happygrapestore.com/blog/reducecarbonfootprint/)"

I use reusable grocery bags and produce bags in stores, but I feel like what I'm doing is hopeless bc ill look around me and see EVERYBODY with tons of plastic bags and everything in stores comes in plastic. I could go to a store that's opened up in my city that sells bamboo toilet paper and toothbrushes, bar soap and shampoo, etc, but it's far away that I'd have to use a car to get there. But mostly, no matter what we do, ill always read about new oil spills in countries that have been unconcerned, and how new coal factories are being built, and how the Amazon rainforest is now emitting more CO2 than it's storing, and our efforts feel hopeless unless industries stop using plastic and fossil fuels.

mekuj5,"Seaspiracy and the truth, let’s discuss Seaspiracy and the truth, let’s discuss.\n\nHello everyone, I just first want to say my intention with this post is to come closer to the truth and have positive discussion. A little about my background, I haven’t finished school yet but I have completed 3 years studying conservation biology and I’m very passionate about the environment and specifically oceans. I watched seaspiracy last night and it shook me to my core, which I’m sure most people would feel watching it. I was shocked and disgusted about the information in this documentary and never realized the extent to which the fishing industry was so horrible for the environment and for animal life. I knew about by catch, plastic pollution, carbon storing in the ocean, etc. but this documentary seemed to take things to another level. \n\nI wanted to learn more and look up reviews and fact checks of the documentary so I could be as unbiased and close to the truth of what is happening as possible. The issue so far seems very polarized— a lot of pro-fishing sources say the documentary is conspiracy, bs, and uses outdated or debunked sources and truth bending reporting basically. The NY times said it’s not really great. Of course there are a lot of sources, pro vegan and environment, saying the exact opposite. Personally my intuition tells me that these issues are pretty awful and not far from what was shown, however I do have a bias with my background and my feelings and am on the path of going vegan with or without watching this doc. I don’t want to be blind to the reality if this is not the case though, and this documentary is highly sensationalized. I’m having a hard time finding sources that show where facts in the documentary came from or where they were refuted (maybe I just need to research myself). \n\nRegardless, I feel like so many issues are so polarized in today’s world that it creates no change at all, each side is pissed at the other and unwilling to budge because of the attitude and treatment of the other. Of course I’m passionate but as I’ve gotten older I’ve realized that the reality of conservation issues (and other social issues) need to involve some sort of compromise and will have to start a lot smaller to begin at all. For example, instead of demonizing people for certain practices, especially in other cultures (dolphin killing, whaling, shark finning as touched on in the doc) recognizing that many of these people do not have another choice given the circumstances they live in and that the world and society sets people up with horrible choices sometimes. Of course I don’t condone any of this, but who am I to judge and even say that something is so morally wrong from such a place of privilege? In my opinion, we can’t just eliminate the fishing industry overnight. We need to provide people alternatives, economic incentives and support to begin changing these issues and go about restoring wildlife populations, because humans focus on humans first and that’s just the world we live in. Of course going vegan is great but you can’t force that onto another person no matter how much you try, you can only live by example. \n\nAnyway... I think sensationalized reporting on either side of an issue can only go so far and I feel can actually make issues harder to change. So I guess with all of this in mind I want to know what your thoughts are on the documentary, this issue in general, and if you have learned about the validity of this information? I would greatly appreciate any insight and perspective that anyone has to offer. :) Lol also I know this was a lot of information, thank you for reading my ramblings."

mer0o0,Summing up climate action!  
mer4qk,"Reducing meat and dairy consumption on a low FODMAPs diet I've been lurking here for awhile and haven't seen this issue raised. I'm wondering if anyone has managed to shift their diet in a more plant-based direction while doing a very restrictive diet like low fodmaps. \n\nIf you don't know what that is, consider yourself fortunate. Basically it's a sensitivity to the complex sugars in a lot of foods- wheat, onion, garlic, stonefruit and apples/pears, brassica vegetables, legumes and lactose. Additionally I have the misfortune of not tolerating unfermented soy at all, or carrageenan, which rules out a lot of non-dairy milks which has that as a thickener. \n\nIt was actually my first attempt at being vegetarian that made me so sick, after some fried tofu, I thought I had poisoned myself. Nope, just can't eat unfermented tofu. Anyway, I've been doing low FODMAPs for 5 years now and it's been completely life changing. No more being up sick all night, no more pain so bad I'm crying in bed waiting for painkillers to start working, no more meals of plain rice. I can exercise outside now and go on long walks without worry or pain. It's really improved my well being so much.\n\nAt the same time I care about the planet and want to reduce my impact on it through the food I eat. Now that my symptoms are under control so much better, I've been able to reintroduce many things I couldn't eat before, like some wheat, a small amount of brassica vegetables, the occasional quarter avocado. I've been able to reintroduce some legumes too, and have got to the point where I can eat small portions of navy beans or fava beans with a dose of beano, plus giving my digestive system a good weeklong break between doses to recover. So far, so good! \n\nAnyway, has anyone else dealt with this? I feel like we usually talk about diet as an ethical choice, and less about the restrictions people may have that make going vegetarian or vegan more difficult. There are some vegan FODMAP bloggers/instagrammers out there, but they seem to be able to tolerate way more beans and brassicas than I can - I really can't afford to overdo it and flare up for days. \n\nThanks for any advice and commiseration!"

I've been working on cutting out plastics next. \n\nI've reached a pickle in my journey, in relation to when you have to buy new products rather than second-hand.\n\nDuring my research, I learned that many alternatives to animal products, such as viscose leather, lead to massive deforestation, and sometimes don't last as long as products made of leather or suede, so I'm not sure if I should be purchasing animal products, or items that contribute to deforestation efforts. My question here, is how do you balance sustainable shopping with ethical shopping?

mgt5fh,"Fact-checking Seaspiracy Hey folks, \n\nI watched Seaspiracy yesterday, and as a PhD student in marine ecology and conservation, I have a lot of thoughts / sources to share. Over the last couple of days, a lot of great scientists that I know, who have dedicated their life's work to protecting marine resources and the livelihoods of people who rely on the sea, have been attacked by people on the internet claiming that they're ""paid off"" or what have you. A lot of the information in the documentary is either false or cherry picked to argue that sustainable fishing isn't possible. A lot of ecologists and fish biologists are pretty upset with the narrative they push - [https://www.iflscience.com/environment/scientists-and-marine-organizations-criticise-netflix-documentary-seaspiracy/](https://www.iflscience.com/environment/scientists-and-marine-organizations-criticise-netflix-documentary-seaspiracy/).\n\n**Even if you watched the film and enjoyed it, please continue reading this post - hear me out.**  Basically, my dislike of the film comes from the fact that they highlight some well-known issues with a few select fisheries, which they then use to insinuate that the entire concept of sustainable fisheries is flawed. Examples of misinformation in the film: \n\n* The filmmakers state all fish will be gone by 2048, but this result is from a 2006 study by Boris Worm and colleagues, which they themselves said was wrong and corrected in a follow-up publication, and which many other fisheries scientists have disputed. What they basically did was draw a curve through past declines in fisheries biomass, and state that if the past rate of decline kept up, the line would intersect 0 at 2048 - but the line hasn't kept up, and global fisheries yield and biomass has largely stagnated since the early 2000's thanks to improved fisheries management. More on this from the University of Washington: [https://sustainablefisheries-uw.org/fisheries-2048/](https://sustainablefisheries-uw.org/fisheries-2048/). **This page is literally** [**the 1st result on google**](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=2048+fisheries)**, so I'm fairly confident the filmmakers had to have known this claim has been discredited.**\n* They attack the marine stewardship council on three bases: (1) an Icelandic fishery they certified which was found to have high bycatch rates, (2) they weren't able to get an interview with MSC, and (3) MSC charges to put their label on seafood. The implication is that MSC is being paid off to label fisheries as sustainable, but there's multiple problems with that assertion: (1) they neglect to mention that [MSC revoked their certification because of the bycatch issues](https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/environment-sustainability/icelandic-lumpfish-fishery-regains-msc-certification-after-addressing-bycatch-issues), and only re-instated them after changes were made to the fishery to control bycatch, (2) MSC doesn't assess fisheries themselves - [third-party groups of fish biologists, ecologists, economists, and social scientists evaluate the fishery, and MSC recieves no payment to certify the fisheries](https://www.msc.org/for-business/fisheries/fishery-certification-guide). They are a nonprofit but they do charge fisheries to use their [""blue tick"" logo](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2021/03/26/response-to-netflix-seaspiracy-film)\-  not sure what that includes, but I think it has to do with training scientists on what the standards of assessment are, providing grants through their ""[Ocean Stewardship](https://www.msc.org/what-we-are-doing/our-collective-impact/ocean-stewardship-fund)""  fund, as well as [conducting DNA tests](https://www.msc.org/for-business/supply-chain) on fisheries with the blue tick label to confirm species of origin. I don't know why he wasn't able to talk to someone from MSC, but that's hardly an admission of guilt. **Basically, the filmmakers make an assertion, without evidence, that MSC is paid off by the fishing industry to label products as sustainable, and in the one example of high bycatch in an MSC fishery that they cite, they ignore the fact that MSC revoked their certification on that basis.**\n* **What's shocking to me is that they never interview any fisheries biologists** \- they interview three conservation biologists, [one of whom has said on twitter that her statement was cherry-picked to support an assertion she disagrees with](https://twitter.com/ChristinacHicks/status/1375390177913372673), and they interview some people from environmental activist groups, but nobody actually working in making fisheries sustainable. They argue that nobody knows how to define ""sustainable"" after talking to like 2 randos at conservation groups, but any fisheries ecologist can define it quite simply: **it's when populations are harvested at a rate that allows them to replenish naturally** \- the concept can be extended to multi-species fisheries, but that's all it is for a single-species fishery. There are many methods used to decide whether a fish population is being harvested at or below the rate at which they can replenish, but it involves estimating fish abundance, the size/age/sex structure of the population, and the survival of juveniles (recruitment) - this is called a [stock assessment](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/fish-stock-assessment-101-part-2-closer-look-stock-assessment-models). **There's thousands of scientists working specifically on fisheries stock assessments worldwide -** and [whole degree programs on fisheries science](https://fish.uw.edu/) \- yet he didn't talk to one fisheries scientist?\n* They highlight only fisheries from Japan, China, etc that are well-known to be unsustainable and have massive human-rights violations, but they don't at all mention that globally, [about 2/3 of fisheries are considered sustainable](https://sustainablefisheries-uw.org/fact-check/how-many-fisheries-are-overfished/) \- in the US, about 85% of fished stocks are sustainably fished, [which is about 99% by weight](https://sustainablefisheries-uw.org/number-of-overfished-us-stocks-at-an-all-time-low/).\n* They discredit aquaculture on the basis of the Scottish Salmon farming industry - I don't really have much to say about this industry because I don't know much about it - but pointing at one bad industry is hardly enough evidence to discard aquaculture. Aquaculture of oysters, for example, has a [very low carbon footprint](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.9b02965?casa_token=EXXyWJkjGocAAAAA%3AmrBcZ_guSFu4l2QJjY_gKwaui_N0rKmInRZe8Xvv3yJg2U9NWH6MUlro2uLhvOp5bfRJ6ex7lViSR3o&amp;) \- and since oysters [improve water quality](https://www.chesapeakebay.net/issues/oysters), it's actually *good* for the environment. They don't talk at all the aquaculture of kelps or other seaweeds, or of freshwater fishes, many of which are considered sustainable - they just hope that you will discount all farmed fish.\n\nSegments about bycatch are excellent, but they insinuate that the exceptional bycatch levels they show are typical, which is purposeful misdirection. They're right that moving away from guilting consumers with not using plastic straws is the right thing to do when the major sources of pollution are industrial, including fishing gear, but they claim that 48% of ocean plastic pollution is fishing gear, when that number is from specifically the great Pacific garbage patch - there are much better estimates globally, and [those are closer to 10%](https://www.greenpeace.de/sites/www.greenpeace.de/files/publications/20190611-greenpeace-report-ghost-fishing-ghost-gear-deutsch.pdf). They also **quickly dismiss climate change as a cause for concern.** I live on the California coast, where our kelp forests (which I frequently work and dive in) have been [completely decimated by a warming climate](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/california-critical-kelp-forests-disappearing-warming-world-can-they-be-saved) \- and one of the *solutions* that's being put forward is to [fish more sea urchins](https://www.urchinomics.com/) to allow the kelp forests to recover from urchin grazing.\n\nI could go on, but you get the idea - there are many instances where the filmmaker has (1) purposefully chosen outlier fisheries and extrapolated these as the norm, (2) relied on dubious or discredited information, and (3) tried to insinuate wide-spread corruption with extremely tenuous evidence. **A lot of the information in the film is good -  but by purposefully leaving out other important information, the filmmaker constructs a narrative that isn't based on fact.** \n\nThe last thing that I really dislike about this film is the filmmaker's agressive ""gotcha"" interview style - the filmmaker talks to multiple people who are just doing their jobs and think they're doing something good, who get flustered when he asks them leading questions which are probably outside of their expertise. **We're meant to take their confusion as admissions of guilt.** It honestly comes across as cruel, and as someone who struggles with social anxiety, that sort of thing terrifies me - I appreciate that most people I've had the chance to talk with about my science have been genuinely interested in what I had to say. That does not appear to be the case here - the filmmaker clearly started interviews wanting to trip people up.\n\n**Now, why does this all matter?** So what if the film is largely inaccurate - isn't it good if it gets people to eat more veggies? **And sure, if you want to eat more veggies - absolutely, go for it!** I myself only eat veggies and some seafood. But realize [all food has environmental costs](https://sustainablefisheries-uw.org/seafood-101/cost-of-food/), and that the environmental cost of many types of seafood are quite low. According to the [FAO](http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/248479/icode/), about 4.3 billion people rely on seafood for 15% of their protein - and with a growing human population, it's irresponsible to ignore seafood as an option. Further, since (I imagine) this film is primarily targeted at western audiences, and western audiences tend to have ready access to sustainable options, I don't think their recommendation that people eat less seafood actually addresses the issues they establish in the film - if you want to avoid supporting fisheries with high bycatch or human rights violations, you can do so quite easily as a western consumer, without dropping seafood from your diet. I do.\n\nFishing isn't perfect, and that's why there's many, many scientists working on protecting marine ecosystems (and not just through fisheries management) - but by painting all fisheries with the same brush, the filmmaker is doing a disservice to the scientists who have spent their lives working to make things better. There are too many statements in the film that are easily falsifiable, so it's hard for me to imagine that the filmmaker wasn't aware that at least some of the statements were false.\n\nIf you want good information on which fisheries are sustainable, I recommend checking out [Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch program](https://www.seafoodwatch.org/), which has information on a bunch of fisheries and why they've either been put on the ""best choice"" or ""avoid"" list. The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a nonprofit and it costs no money for a fishery to be listed on their Seafood Watch interface - they use funds from admission for research and sea otter rehabilitation. For good, straightforward information about the concepts and research behind fisheries, [check this department-run website out](https://sustainablefisheries-uw.org/), which I've linked to a couple times here."

mh05jt,"Issues With Seaspiracy on Netflix I just watched Seaspiracy, and I have a lot of thoughts just like everyone else. One thing the film did extremely well is transition from problem to problem, as well as using ethos at the end (the whale hunt) to compel the viewer and finish up by having the whole thing be an ad for veganism.\n\nLike many, including the documenter himself, I had no idea about most of this. One thing I wish the film spent more time on is HOW we are to save the ocean. At the very end, they had tips that included:\n\n1. ""No Take"" zones must be established and enforced\n2. Governments must stop harmful subsidies\n3. Avoid eating marine animals\n\nWhile these are great, it does not go into at all HOW these are to be done. HOW are you going to establish and enforce ""no take"" zones? What needs to go into that? How do we start doing that? I would assume the answer, like most every question relating to big issues, is to VOTE for the politicians that are elected to figure these questions out.\n\nI'm curious to hear your opinion that goes into more depth about how we can get this done."

mhcofr,"On the recent ""Fact Check"" of Seaspiracy Hey everyone,\n\nI saw a post here that was on the front page of this subreddit, which has now been removed (assuming because of misinformation). I want to call out some of the points that the poster made in addition to actually being diligent with fact checking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOP's main source was [https://sustainablefisheries-uw.org/about/](https://sustainablefisheries-uw.org/about/) which he cited for almost every one of the sources he listed. If you check their about page under the ""Who is Funding"" section:\n\n""The money comes from the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at UW, which oversees the project. Contributors to the project include various philanthropic foundations, government grants, international organizations, environmental NGOs, and **some fishing companies and their affiliated NGOs**.""\n\n  \nI'm not going to break down every point that he made, but when someone says ""**This page is literally** [**the 1st result on google**](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=2048+fisheries)**, so I'm fairly confident the filmmakers had to have known this claim has been discredited""**... that is not an actual research method and directly references a source that is funded by the fishing industry. He claims to be a PhD marine biologist and doesn't even know how to do basic research. I'm not even saying that everything Seaspiracy said was accurate, but you can't provide shit secondary sources and expect that to be a legit argument. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegarding the dispute of 46% of plastic in is from fishing gear and the claim that only 10% of plastic in the ocean is fishing gear. [This is the source](https://www.greenpeace.de/sites/www.greenpeace.de/files/publications/20190611-greenpeace-report-ghost-fishing-ghost-gear-deutsch.pdf) that was referred to by OP. This is actually a valid point, the documentary does say all oceans have this much plastic, but in fact this 46% statistic ([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w)) refers to the great pacific Garbage Patch. \n\nIf you are curious about the 10% statistic (2009) this primary source can be found [here](http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/newsroom/docs/Ghost_fishing_report.pdf). Skip to page 33 (Chapter 2 Magnitude and Composition of ALDFG) where it talks about contents. Its actually an interesting chapter and would recommend checking it out, but they admit ""The few attempts at broad-scale quantification of the source of marine litter to date enable a crude approximation that indicates ALDFG contributes less than 10 percent of global marine litter by volume."" So they admit this is a crude approximation based on previous studies in local areas. Keep in mind the 10% statistic comes from a study in 2009 and the 46% is from 2018.  A lot can change in 10 years, not only in the amount of plastic in the ocean but new studies like the one cited in Seaspiracy provide more in depth research into contents of these garbage patches. “I knew there would be a lot of fishing gear, but 46 percent was unexpectedly high,” \[Laurent Lebreton, an oceanographer with the Ocean Cleanup\] says. “Initially, we thought fishing gear would be more in the 20 percent range. That is the accepted number \[for marine debris\] globally—20 percent from fishing sources and 80 percent from land.” [Source For Quote](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/great-pacific-garbage-patch-plastics-environment)\n\nSo the researchers in the Pacific Garbage Patch study expected closer to what OP was referring to but were blown out of the water (pun intended) by the results (which I linked above). So yes, the movie seaspiracy misused this statistic but we don't really know the full picture and they made it clear that fishing nets and equipment contribute an enormous amount of plastic in our oceans (even a low ball 10% plastics being fishing gear from a 12 year old study is alarming). \n\n""If you want to avoid supporting fisheries with high bycatch or human rights violations, you can do so quite easily as a western consumer, without dropping seafood from your diet. I do."" Another main point was this, which he provided no evidence of. First of all they interviewed the head of The Dolphin Safe food label and the head of it straight said ""There is no way we can actually verify they aren't killing dolphins"" So i don't know how you can argue that you can when the head of a ""sustainable fishing"" organization said that even he couldn't tell. Think about this logically, if you are using massive nets to catch all the fish in an area, there is no technology that is going to avoid things like dolphins and sea turtles. They will get caught in the nets too and will be dead by the time you bring them up. You can't filter out what you want to catch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm not going to go through every thing he said but almost every link was to one website ([https://sustainablefisheries-uw.org/about/](https://sustainablefisheries-uw.org/about/)) which again is funded by fisheries. \n\n  \nConclusion:\n\nA problem that is often run into when looking at studies like this is the incentives behind studies and articles. Big oil pushed how their products were sustainable and were the ones who created the recycling industry to try and make people feel like using plastic was okay and that recycling was sustainable way of dealing with trash. Food industries do this too, there are studies funded by industries that are directly at a conflict of interest. Whether it be the sugar industry pointing the finger at fats and away for themselves or Animal agriculture funding studies claiming red meat is good for you. What makes you think the fishing industry won't do the same?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou should be weary of sources and try and understand what the statistics mean and who funded them. This includes documentaries like Seaspircy. [https://www.seaspiracy.org/](https://www.seaspiracy.org/) This is there website and they will release their statistics soon according to them, so look into the statistics yourself when they post them. But don't use a half ass Fact check to ignore how unsustainable the fishing industry is. You are just looking for an excuse to continue your habits. There is no such thing as sustainable fishing, the numbers of fish in our oceans have plummeted, and it doesn't take a genius to understand that we have demolished fish populations across the world. \n\nI am not going to say that every point they made was completely 100% accurate and im sure they exaggerated some points, but that doesn't invalidate the whole documentary. OP said that sustainable fishing is possible without any real evidence, he just pointed out a few discrepancies without actual sources.\n\nEven if that guy was right and we can sustainably fish (which we can't) then it still doesn't even make sense for you to continue eating fish. We NEED a massive rebound of fish populations and if you are still eating fish then you are prohibiting this recovery even if it is ""sustainable"". If you think the pleasure you get from 5 minutes of eating fish outweigh the importance of preserving a massive ecosystem, then I don't know what to tell you. This is probably poorly written so sorry, ive been multitasking while doing my job."

mhg7ec,"How shopper choice influences companies Hey folks - I wrote the following article for my company's website and would love to get your thoughts! Pasting here so you don't need to go to our site. \n\nKotoo subscribers have put sustainability on autopilot by taking the most impactful sustainable action - [converting coal power plants to renewable energy](https://www.kotoo.earth/offsets). And you should sleep easy at night knowing that action is 20-40x more powerful than nearly any other sustainability recommendation because it causes systemic change in the [power plants directly causing 40% of our pollution](https://info.kotoo.earth/hc/en-us/articles/360058439833-Why-powerplants-are-the-key-to-climate-change). Money spent restricting power plants' access to necessary pollution permits limits the supply of pollution to the air and is probably the sustainable solution you haven't heard of.\n\nBut what about all the sustainable recommendations you have heard of? We classify most of these recommendations as demand side solutions - if you can reduce consumer demand for polluting products, then those products will disappear because they aren't profitable. And I can hear the skepticism - haven't we been doing that for years?\n\nThe difference is that now sustainability has entered the mainstream consciousness thanks to Al Gore, Greta Thunberg, and the uptick in intensity of natural disasters. Regardless of the cause, the fact is - public awareness of climate change is causing companies to change. And here's the evidence: \n\n1. A recent study from 2013 to 2018 revealed that sustainably-marketed goods gain market share 5x [faster than conventional counterparts.](https://hbr.org/2019/06/research-actually-consumers-do-buy-sustainable-products?registration=success)\n2. As a result, more companies than ever are trying to position themselves as sustainable. Everyone from investors to consumers are pressuring companies to change, and we're seeing results as more and more companies announce carbon neutral commitments than ever before. \n\nSo how can you execute sustainable consumer choice without doing a lot of research or worrying about [greenwashing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greenwashing.asp)? Here are two dead simple things you can do (we only recommend things that don't involve significant personal sacrifice).\n\n1.   Choose less packaging first and then choose paper, glass, and metal containers over plastic. Plastic recycling is largely a lie (don't get us started on how marketing and branding make you believe that plastic is recyclable) but glass, metal, and paper are infinitely recyclable. In fact you can spot things already made from recycled materials when glass is green or brown and paper is off-white. With 75% of the recyclable things going to the landfill, it's just better to avoid plastic as much as possible right when you buy it (do you really need a plastic produce bag? you're going to wash that produce anyways right?). Plastic isn't going anywhere, but if you look at something plastic and have a glass or metal option, choose that. Things like Olive Oil, 6-packs packaged in a cardboard box vs. with plastic snaps, etc.\n     Glass and metal take energy to recycle but as electricity moves towards renewables, it'll only become cleaner and cleaner. And since they're infinitely recyclable, we still save on all the mining and industrial chemicals made to . Most plastics either too small, too thin or are complex mixes of polymers and can't be effectively recycled (only recycle Types 1, 2, and 5, larger than 2"" in diameter). Overall - recycling and packaging aren't going to solve climate change since packaging only makes up a few percent of a product's carbon footprint, but it does have downstream impacts on the health of natural ecosystems which do have a significant impact on keeping the planet operating smoothly. \n\n2.    Choose pork or chicken over beef. If you don't care what type of protein is in your dish, pork and chicken have much lower environmental impacts because they don't burp methane (all grazing animals burp significant amounts of methane, a gas 84x more powerful than CO2) and don't cause as much deforestation. If your meat dish is heavily flavored - try a meat substitute (i.e. BeyondBeef). You'll get a similar texture to hold all that flavor. I like a good steak as much as anyone, but things like sausage or breakfast meatballs are so heavily spiced and sauced that meat substitutes are close enough that you can't tell the difference.  \n    From a carbon footprint perspective - this simple choice can lower your footprint 10-30% since your diet makes up 5-10% of your footprint and chicken has a 30% lower impact than beef. \n \n\nOver the next couple months we'll let you know the companies that are leading their industries in sustainability (super-retailers like Amazon vs Target, airlines like Southwest and Delta, etc.). If you're trying to decide where to shop, these recommendations will help you focus on the sustainable options. \n\n \n\nIn summary, when it's easy:\n\n1. Choose pork or chicken instead of beef\n2. Glass, metal, and paper are always better than plastic\n3. Only recycle plastic types 1, 2, and 5 (triangle on the bottom) larger than 2""\n \nIf you liked articles like this, you can get them in your inbox with a free Kotoo account - [Join Kotoo for free](https://www.kotoo.earth) - in two minutes, we'll calculate a detailed history of last year's carbon footprint for free.

What is the point of me bringing this reusable cup when they are just going to use the plastic one to measure the drink and dirty another ceramic cup to put my reusable one in?!\n\nDo you have any thoughts about this? I have also seen that Starbucks sells its own reusable cups. I am wondering if they then also use the extra plastic. But I don't want to buy another cup just so they don't use the extra plastic when I get coffee there. And buying the extra cup when it is also not really necessary kind of defeats the purpose...\n\nI know it is only a small act in trying to live more sustainably but I think that it's these small changes in your live that add up and can make a change. And it kind of angers me when even these small acts are defeated.\n\nI have also gained more interest in how bigger companies take on these sustainability challenges. Would love to discuss more about this and how other companies tackle these kind of issues. And maybe we could even find a solution to tackle these small but important challenges!"

I often hear people saying, just to give an example, that in order to avoid intensive farming or seafishing which are harmful for the planet, we just should stop eating meat and fish. I mean this is all beautiful ethically speaking, but individual choices, in my opinion, will never lead to a final solution of the problem. That's the reason why I don't stop eating these stuffs. I don't feel guilty about that, I don't feel like I'm doing something bad because I think that the blame should not be put on the final consumer, but on the governments (or whatever entity is supposed to vigilate on these matters) which are not doing a fuck in order to preserve the planet.

So, do the benefits of battery operated lawnmowers (and power tools in general) namely reduced emissions, outweigh the impacts of producing the lithium batteries. Or, am I just pushing my impacts (lithium mining, fossil fuel use to produce the required electricity, and subsequent emissions) down the road where I don't have to feel personally attached to them?\n\nTL/DR is a battery powered lawnmower really that much more sustainable than a gas one, all things considered?"

It was really eye opening for me to read about something like that in action, and though I've been a vegetarian for almost 8 years, I often shop at Fred Meyer or other big grocery stores. I'm looking to start eating more locally grown and seasonal produce (and locally raised meat for my family) but it's all kind of overwhelming and I'm not sure where to begin.\n\nI guess I'd start at a local grocery store that uses as much local supply as it can, but stuff doesn't always say where it's from, and when it does there's no guarantee it was grown sustainably. Do I go full portlandia and check out these local farms for myself and maybe join a cult?

This I know.\n\nHowever, many of the alternatives to making things out of plant matter entail using petro, oil-based derivatives.\n\nSo, my question is, why is making a product out of, say, cactus more sustainable than making a product out of cellulose from trees? I figure some plants must account for a greater amount of carbon capture  than others. But is this related to mass? Which property of plant life helps us understand the amount of carbon absorbed?"

msom74,"Let's talk about coffee... Java, joe, mud, whatever you call it, many of us start out day with a cup of it. However, coffee comes in many guises and in the post I wanted to go other some of the pros and cons of the different ways to consume coffee. I'll focus on brewing method and certifications.\n\nI'm a researcher in food sustainability. Whilst coffee isn't my specialism, I've attended seminars and had discussions with those for whom it is. Hopefully that, combined with my own experience gives me some foundation.\n\nThe topic is almost endless and this can't possibly be complete guide, but hopefully I'll go over some of the main things to consider. Needless to say, I'm sure you can all add millions of points to this and disagree with particular comments etc. Each type of coffee consumption also has different pros and cons, not all of which are directly comparable. Consequently, some of this is based on subjective judgement. \n\n# How you make it\n\n**Pod machines** \- Coffee pod machines are now common place. Their negative is obvious, the production and disposal of single use capsules. Their main positive is that they use smaller amounts of coffee than any other brewing method.\n\nRegarding the pods, they can come in various guises. Nespresso and other ***aluminium*** pods can be recycled endlessly, this does reduce their impact (as aluminium mining is very damaging) however, you still have that initial cost + the cost of recycling, so it by no means absolves them. ***Plastic*** pods, in my view, should be avoided as they usually have an aluminium seal and with the coffee grounds still inside I'm highly sceptical about if they are truly recycled when it comes to it. You can buy ***re-usable*** capsules that you fill yourself. These can be plastic or metal. They have mixed reviews and be aware that the plastic ones have quite limited life spans. Metal re-usable pods are a very good option to reduce your coffee impact. ***Compostable*** pods are now available (Eden Project, Rave Coffee) which solves the waste issue. Compared to aluminium, I honestly don't know how they match up, it all depends where the source material comes from. However, I opt for compostable as it has an obvious benefit on the waste, supports sustainable innovation, and businesses willing to do that are likely thinking of other things they can do.\n\nI would especially avoid any pod machines that take specialised bespoke pods, they limit your choice and the machine has a high risk of being redundant in the near future.\n\n**Espresso machine** \- Espresso machines have limited packaging waste and generally are on-par with other non-pod coffee. The main downside of espresso machines is the machine itself, which requires significant resources to manufacture. The machine also has a somewhat limited lifespan. This is the option I personally use.\n\n**Stove top** \- Many of the benefits of the espresso machine, but with a far lower material input to the machine itself. A good stove-top espresso maker will also outlive you. The primary downside here is that they are not energy efficient, a lot of heat is wasted from the stove. However, if you have renewable energy powering an electric stove, this is a very desirable choice.\n\n**Drip, filter, and cafetiere** \- Less common than they were, but produce large volumes of brew relative to the coffee used. So an excellent choice for families, offices, groups etc. Gravity filter coffee has less machine inputs that the electric drip devices. Filter papers obviously have a cost (they can be re-used a few times though). A good cafetiere can last a lifetime, so a strong choice there. Clear taste limitations on all of these though.\n\n**Instant** \- A huge benefit of instant is that it requires no new equipment, assuming you already own a kettle. Regarding production, it is generally considered the least impactful way to consume coffee. The downside is, of course, the taste. If you don't enjoy it, the environmental impact is absolutely not worth it.\n\n# Certification\n\n**Fairtrade** \- This certification essentially means that producers and workers are paid fairly for their work and crop and that they are generally buffered from things like price fluctuations. For me, this is a really important label to look for.\n\n**Rainforest Alliance** \- This certification shares some of the aspects of Fairtrade but is also focussed on maintaining the environmental status of land and waterways. Another one I look out for.\n\n**Organic** \- I'll be honest, I actively avoid organic coffee. Of course there are pros and cons to organic production. But within the coffee industry, the growing demand for organic has lead to increased deforestation. Furthermore, organic crops have lower yields, so require more land to produce the same volume of coffee. Obviously, there's a notable GHG emission with inorganic fertilisers though. It's a pretty close call on this IMO.\n\n# Other considerations\n\n**Bulk-buy** \- The bigger a pack is, the less packaging it has per weight of product. Obviously this only applies if you don't buy so much it spoils.\n\n**Packaging** \- Keep an eye on what your coffee is packaged in. Some brands (Rave) offer compostable packaging, others recyclable, and others not recyclable at all. Many zero waste shops also sell coffee, eliminating packaging all together.\n\n**Compost your grounds** \- Coffee is high in Nitrogen and a great fertiliser. Use your grounds on your plants.\n\n**Take your own cup** \- We all know this and in Covid times it's more tricky. But coffee cups are a huge source of waste. So if you can, take your own with you when you buy coffee out.\n\n**Second hand machines** \- Machines are a huge source of the impacts, so do try and get second hand machines, or at least machines that will last well, that you'll take care of.\n\n**The best thing you can do is to not drink coffee** \- Coffee is not essential, we drink it for pleasure. If you do not drink it at all, or even skip a cup or two here and there, you're guaranteed to be reducing all impacts. Of course, we are allowed to enjoy things in life, that includes coffee, it's your decision as to what you do or do not think is worth it."

mv8mqr,"Is it actually egoistic to care about sustainability? Don't get me wrong, I'm trying to be live as sustainable as I can and I'm not planning to stop, this is just something I wonder about sometimes and I'm looking for good arguments against it: Nature in the grand scheme of things doesn't ""care"" if it get's destroyed, it's kinda the circle of life. It certainly doesn't care if humanity goes extinct. Individual animals probably don't even now when they are the last of their species. It's just sad for us to know that we killed another whole species and messed up our eco-system even more.\nThey always say ""we need to save the earth for future generations"". But those people aren't even born yet, they don't have feelings now at maybe they won't actually care. Also it's again only a human problem that we want our future generations to have what we have. So is it actually an egoistic thing (by humans in general) to care about sustainability? Is it morally ""right"" to expect people who are living right now to inconvenience themselves for future generations who aren't even alive yet and maybe never will be?"

mvars6,"Breaking the grass ceiling: How can we shift discussions on sustainability to be about more than the environment? Environmentalism often dominates sustainability discourse. The subreddit itself is a good example. You will struggle to find posts here that aren’t environmentally focused. This is despite the subreddit explicitly defining sustainability in a way that should encourage broader views incorporating a kind of “three pillars” approach that also factors in the economy and society. \n\nSustainability is a multidisciplinary discourse. Any and every discipline out there can be applied to the questions, concerns, and observations that sustainability preoccupies itself with. In actuality, three pillars (society, economy, environment) aren’t anywhere near enough to capture the breadth of it all, but we can appreciate that three is better than one and so this isn’t a criticism of the definition of sustainability the subreddit provides. Even if it’s limited, it should still encourage a broader discussion, and yet…doesn’t. \n\nEverything is relevant or can be made relevant with the right questions and framing. Economics, gender studies, astronomy, psychology, marketing, organisational management, art, history, philosophy, decolonial studies…there isn’t a discipline out there that doesn’t have something important to contribute. If it’s not clear to you how, just ask me and I’ll do my best to show you how x discipline is relevant.  \n\nYet environmentalism dominates. Ecological concerns dominate. \n\nI understand that issues like climate change represent ecological problems in fundamental ways, but I also passionately believe that such issues are not reducible to that alone. Pick any sustainability issue from climate change to meat consumption to planetary boundaries and you will very quickly realize there are other factors that play hugely influential roles: economics, politics, culture, religion, geopolitics and security, and on the list goes. \n\nScholars in this space have long known this. The point that “sustainability” is more than environmentalism had been made from the very first moments the discipline became mainstream, and well before. \n\nYet here we are in 2021, many decades into academics making this point repeatedly, and we are still seeing sustainability dominated by the colour green, by environmental motifs (leaves, trees, and hands holding the earth are the dominant iconography), and by discussions that focus primarily if not exclusively on environmental concerns. \n\nHow can we change this? How can we encourage a broader discourse?"

mvgz3c,"To the parents or against having no children for the sake of reducing emissions Recently, i've stumbled across something i can only describe as dangerous within the green/sustainability movement. Its the idea that you should have less children since each person causes x amount of emissions. Ignoring the fact that this is more or less the less physically violent version of the ecofascist idea of killing ""less valueable"" people to reduce emissions since it doesn't demand directly inflicting harm on living indivduals, on top of ignoring that the emissions a person causes aren't fixed values, instead changing based on technological advancement and lifestyle, it also works entirely in the wrong direction. This idea is based on the image that the number of people is the problem and ignores the fact that the individual is hardly responsible for the ecological apocalypse we see looming on the horizon. The issue is instead almost entirely to blame on the production side of things, from what is produced, how, how it is marketed, where the raw materials are procured from, for which purpose it is produced (human need vs profit) all the way down to how it gets to us. The only way to really affect this side is by fighting on the political level, for regulations, for change in the political and economic system, for more political power in the hands of the people who have to suffer the majority of its effects. In this situation, where it a political struggle against those who seek only their own gain, ignoring the impact of their endless greed for greater profit, having less of us or even eventually dying out is the biggest issue we could have. So no, definitely don't have less children if your reason for being reluctant is how their impact might hasten climate change. Instead, make sure you raise them to become people who can see the lies corporations try to feed us (greenwashing, corrupt studies and so on), who try to help those who are in need and who can carry the torch of trying to avoid the worst of this climate crisis. We'll need their brains to discover technologies to halt and reverse the damage of the past, their hands to build the projects we'll need to put such technologies into practice and their voices to bring about the change needed to even begin on working on them. In the midst of the now unavoidable climate crisis, the coming generations will be the ones who decide the fate of humanity. After all, if we fail, there probably won't be a habitable planet Earth, much less a human species on it."

Things like bulk bins at grocery stores or places that I would usually go for lunch that had sustainable options now loading you up with plastic forks and such... it makes me sick.\n\nI used to beat myself up that I wasn't at 100% sustainability. My partner kept and keeps reminding me that most people aren't even putting in 95% effort and that I can make a bigger difference moving other folks from the ~50% mark to the 95% than trying to get myself to 100%.\n\n I would call myself an environmentally considerate person. I am blessed to live in a city where I can bike almost anywhere from my home instead of driving, I try not to use any products that don't degrade when washed down the sink, try to avoid plastics as much as possible, eat a vegetarian diet with limited eggs and cheese (they come from my friends farm!), buy local produce, etc, etc.\n\nBut it feels like so many things are turning the opposite direction. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to get to is: \n\n1) what are your 5% cheat things and why do you let yourself do them? (Ie. Finding vegan cheese around here is full of plastic, where as the cheese from the local cow farm near me has a much more reasonable amount of plastic. I would buy the vegan cheeses more often if they had more sustainable packaging)\n\n2) how do we get other people to the ""95%"" mark? (For example, a friend of mine only drinks carbonated bottled water, but there's so much plastic, transportation cost and then the recycling infrastructure where I live is non-existent. How do I get this person to care about what they're doing to this fragile earth, our collective home)"

I just wanted to share some happy news with y'all :) The past few years, a few small Canadian west coast businesses started a campaign around black Friday called blue Friday. Essentially they pledge to donate proceeds from Nov 26th (Black Friday) towards ocean conservation initiatives on the west coast of Canada. The last two years they raised money to install several sea bins (which are basically trash collectors for the ocean)! This year they had a goal of raising $12,000 to replace a ESP foam doc in Tofino that created a lot of the plastic debris that ended up in the seabins. \n\n  \nThis year over 20 brands came together to put sales proceeds towards ocean conservation and together they raised $40,000!! Thats almost 4x their goal. This is just an example of the amazing people in the world working so hard to protect nature &lt;3 Hope this story makes you smile! \n\nLinking their instagram [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXCOKY0hCSf/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), and linking their website [here](https://www.blue-friday.ca/) if you'd like to read the story yourself :)"

raxjw1,"Why I Started to Make Every Day Earth Day In the spring of 2017, my fiancé and I relocated from Virginia to the state of Ohio in order for him to pursue a career opportunity. The two of us had grown up in Virginia and both of our families still reside there to this day, so this move was a large adjustment for us. We had become accustomed to all of the beautiful amenities that Virginia had to offer; we had access to mountains with the nearby Appalachian trail, the beach with Virginia Beach and Yorktown Beach, famous amusement parks such as Busch Gardens, and so much more. We had no idea what to expect from Ohio, except a significant decrease in the average temperature and an increase in snowfall. However, the climate and landscape of Virginia was not the only thing that we were longing for after the move.\n\nIt only took a few months of living in Ohio for us to feel homesick and miss being able to interact with our friends and family members on a daily basis. Of course we had the convenience of modern day technology which allowed us to call them, text them, and even FaceTime them—but virtual interactions are just not the same. One day on FaceTime with my fiancé’s six-year-old brother, Mike, I had an idea about other ways that we could stay in communication. I thought we could take a more old school approach, and asked him, “Would you want to be my pen-pal?” I saw his confused face just staring blankly back at me on the screen. Initially, I assumed that his camera had frozen, but really he just had no clue what a pen-pal was! After a short explanation of the definition, he eagerly agreed to write to me once a month. Of course this would require his Mom to assist him in reading my letters, writing his responses, and mailing his letters to me, so we had to get her on board as well. She agreed to help us in the process and I began to draft my first letter to him.\n\nIt took me a while to settle on a topic for my first letter to Mike. Keeping in mind that I have always had a fascination with nature and my go to activities always took place outdoors, I thought it would be a fun idea to create a nature based scavenger hunt. The two of us could complete the scavenger hunt in our respective states, me in Ohio and him in Virginia, and be able to compare our findings. The scavenger hunt was simple and required us to take a “nature walk” and try to locate various items along the way. The items had to match the requirements and characteristics outlined on the list. For example, one item had to be blue while another had to be rough. I had to be mindful of the attention span of a six-year-old boy, so there were only around eight items for us to find on the walk. I went out to a nearby park that same day and collected all eight items from the list. Some of my items included a sleek sheath stone from the Rocky River riverbed, a pastel blue chip from a crushed robin’s egg, a black and red speckled bird’s feather, and the star of the show—a four leaf clover. I delicately wrapped my bounty in a few layers of paper towel, slipped it into an envelope with proper postage, put the parcel in the mailbox, and eagerly waited for his reply.\n\nAfter waiting a week for his letter to arrive, my anticipation had been building. I just could not wait to see what items he had collected and see how similar or different they were from my own. I used my index finger to break the seal on the envelope, being careful not the damage the natural goodies inside. I peeled back the flap of the envelope and peered inside. To my surprise, I did not see the organic materials I had expected to see like twigs and pebbles, but instead I saw a variety of synthetic materials such as a string of blue yarn, a crinkled M&amp;M’s wrapper, a piece of wrinkly newspaper, and a small shiny shard of glass. While he had successfully completed the scavenger hunt and checked off all of the required items, he had only included one natural item in the entirety of his collection: a singular dry brown leaf.\n\nI was absolutely devastated that these were the items that his “nature walk” had resulted in. Seeing this collection of items impacted me in a way that I was not expecting it to. I began to think about the environment as a whole and I started to fear that our future generations, such as Mike’s generation, might not have access to nature in the same way that I did growing up. I want Mike to be able to experience the natural world just as I did, but I fear that human impact and pollution might not allow him to do so. This scavenger hunt situation was a wakeup call for me, and caused me to analyze my own contribution to the poor condition and outlook of our environment. I researched the various agencies responsible for creating laws to protect the environment, the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as the systems we currently have in place to minimize human impact. I did not feel that these were adequate and it got me thinking, what can we do as individuals to make an impact? I believe that we have a responsibility to take care of our environment and ensure that we protect it for our future generations through environmental preservation and conservation. This was when I truly became passionate about protecting the environment.\n\nFrom then on I made small adjustments to my daily living to help reduce my contribution to environmental pollution. I switched to reusable cotton pads, I purchased a set of reusable portable utensils, and stopped using paper towels and disposable water bottles. I vowed to monitor my usage of electricity and water, making sure to turn off light switches and faucets if I was not actively using them. I also decided to try to car pool or make use of public transportation whenever possible. While these changes may seem small or insignificant in the grand scheme of things, it is important to remember that every little bit helps. I believe that we each have a responsibility to do our part to protect and preserve the environment. If we don’t, what will that mean for Mike’s generation or the generation after him? In my next letter to Mike, I explained the meaning and importance of environmental preservation and conservation, and included a check-list of all of the day to day changes he could make to help do his part. I took this opportunity to change my own actions and to teach Mike about the consequences his own actions can have on the world. I managed to take this unfortunate situation and give it a positive outcome.\n\nI encourage each of you reading this to take the time to analyze your own contributions to our current environmental dilemmas and look for ways to both reduce your negative impacts and increase your positive impacts. This might be in the form of actively volunteering for or donating to environmental renewal projects in your community, while in other cases it might be simply picking up a piece of trash you come across on the beach, turning off the lights/water when not actively using them, sorting your waste for landfill items vs. recyclable items, or carpooling to work to reduce emissions. It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that these small acts will not make an impact on the overall situation, but in reality, these small efforts can and do have a huge impact. Living a greener and more environmentally conscious lifestyle could have a ripple effect leading others to follow in your footsteps. We can make a difference and I feel that we have an obligation to try. What part will you play in this issue and what will you do to make a positive change?\n\n**TL;DR** I created a nature based scavenger hunt for me and my young relative to complete. We had to find items that matched certain descriptions like: something blue or something rough. I found natural items such as rocks, leaves, and feathers while he found synthetic items such as yarn, wrappers, and newspaper. This made me fear for his generation and forced me to recognize the need for environmental protection and conservation. I made changes in my own life and encourage readers to do the same. How can we work both individually and collectively to combat this issue?"
razkmh,Are These ‘Water-Soluble’ Bags Really a Solution to Single-Use Plastics in the Fashion Industry?  
rb2kyq,"CULT Food Science Establishes Global Cellular Agriculture Advisory Board There are two kinds of agricultural products derived from cell culture: acellular products and cellular products. Acellular products are made of organic molecules like proteins and fats and contain no cellular or living material in the final product. Cellular products are made of living or once-living cells. Products harvested from cell culture are exactly the same as those harvested from an animal; the only difference is how they are made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAcellular animal-sourced foods (like milk) can be made without animals by using a microbe like yeast or bacteria. In the example of milk made with yeast, the yeast are altered by inserting into them the gene carrying the blueprints for casein, a milk protein. Since all cells read the same genetic code, the yeast, now carrying so-called recombinant DNA, makes casein identical to the casein cows make in their milk. Most cellular products exist in tissues. In cellular agriculture, tissues are made outside the body in a process called tissue engineering. Cells from a particular species and tissue type are assembled on a scaffold (to grow on) with serum (food for the cells to feed on while they grow) in an environment that promotes growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, tissue engineering is a relatively new scientific pursuit, with a focus on clinical applications such as growing skin for burn victims or organs for patients requiring organ transplantation. The focus is on the tissue having a biological function — in other words, the tissue-engineered organ needs to be able to work in a living person. While the science behind growing tissue for an organ transplant is similar to growing muscle tissue for food, both come with a set of very different considerations. For example, tissues for meat or leather do not need to work as an organ in someone’s body. Instead, meat needs to have a particular nutritional value, mouthfeel, or taste. Leather needs to have a certain strength, texture, or softness. All cellular agriculture products need to be made affordably — that means producing tissues at a scale much larger than what is required for patients requiring organ transplants.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCompared to their conventional counterparts, cellular agriculture products have fewer environmental impacts, a safer, purer product, and a more consistent supply. This is because the product is being produced in safe, sterile, controlled conditions. Cellular agriculture has the ability to design and tune what you are making. For instance, you could make meat with fewer saturated fats and more unsaturated fats, or you could make leather of different thicknesses. You could make milk without lactose, or eggs without cholesterol. Despite the benefits and opportunities presented by cellular agriculture, it remains an underfunded area of research.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCult food science investment platform for cellular agriculture does not only acknowledge this, but is trying to actively change it. The company has just established a global cellular agriculture advisory board to guide the company’s pursuit of defendable cellular agriculture-focused intellectual property, patents and royalty streams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey have assembled such a world class Advisory Board, all thought leaders in their respective areas of cellular agriculture, cell biology, pharmacology, biotechnology and alternative protein solutions. Dr. Paul Burridge is an esteemed pharmacologist who is currently conducting research around induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) for the purpose of advancing cultivated meat. Rob Harris is a active- start-up advisor focused on bridging the gap between scientific possibility and commercially viable products in the field of cellular agriculture. Dr. Anjum Mullani an alumnus of Institut Pasteur, Paris’ Department of developmental and stem cell biology, animal biotechnology, molecular biology and cellular senescence. Dr. Mullani is focused on applying her diverse knowledge base to accelerate the advancement of cellular agriculture. That's not all, don't fret...Cult expects to add other members to the Advisory Board in due course, as appropriate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe global factory farming and aquaculture crises are intensifying in real time, posing a major threat to the world as we know it. Cellular agriculture will be the solution and change we need. However we need to do our part by informing ourselves and investing green. Companies such as CULT Food science, have unprecedented exposure to the most innovative start-ups, private or early-stage cultivated meat and cultured dairy companies around the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey have leading revolutionary investees, and as soon as their IPO goes public $CULT, they will be changing the game for cellular agriculture. Do not take my advice as a financial advisor, I'm just here to spread awareness, and try to change our planet one investment at a time. Do your own research and be the change."

rbvaxq,"Studies on the relative impacts of different vegetable oils. Please read, it's important. \nI see a very problematic damaging factoid about palm oil has become established in green spaces. It seems to be very pervasive.\n\nI will post numerous recent sources for my claims here. See the sources below and quotes from them about that\n\nSo lets start. \n\n**_Palm oil is in reality one of the less damaging oils._**\n\n**Heres the relative impact of different cooking oils, with sources (studies included) and quotes;**\n\n1.	https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/sustainability/sustainability-13-01813/article_deploy/sustainability-13-01813.pdf\n\n⁠""In an effort to reduce environmental damage, a number of public campaigns have led to consumer pressure on food companies, resulting in the substitution of palm oil with al- ternative vegetable oils and the labelling of palm oil-free products [17,18]. Notwithstanding the technical challenges of substituting palm oil [19], it has recently been suggested that this strategy may potentially have adverse effects, given that lower-yielding oil crops require up to 10 times more land than oil palm to produce a given quantity of vegetable oil [14,20,21]. Whilst alternative oil crops may have a smaller environmental footprint per hectare than oil palm, their larger area requirements could imply that the total environmental impact associated with the production of one litre of vegetable oil is actually higher than for oil palm""\n\n2) ""Updating the 2018 IUCN situation analysis on oil palm and biodiversity, the new study finds that oil palm now makes up around 40% of the current global vegetable oil supply despite occupying only around 5.5% of the total global oil crop area (between 21.5 and 23.4 million hectares). For comparison, soy for oil production is planted in an area of 125 million hectares, or almost 30% of oil crop area worldwide, while supplying 28% of the vegetable oil demand. Oil palm plantations have accounted for more than half of local deforestation in e.g. Malaysian Borneo in recent decades, but are estimated to contribute moderately to deforestation globally. No reliable data is available on the amount of deforestation other oils have caused.""\n\n“When it comes to the end use, vegetable oils are mostly interchangeable – but they differ in how productive they are and in their impacts on the environment. For instance, average yields for oil palm per unit area are several times those of rapeseed, soy, groundnut, cotton, coconut or sunflower. This implies that, if palm oil continues to play a dominant role in overall oil production, an additional 35.7 million hectares of oil plantations could meet the projected demand in 2050. This would mean an 8% increase in land use. If on the other hand, the less productive soy were used to meet this demand, an additional 204 million hectares of tropical and subtropical land would be needed, or a 48% increase compared to now (!!!!)"", said Professor Douglas Sheil of the Norwegian University of Life Science, a co-author on the study.\n\nhttps://www.iucn.org/news/science-and-economics/202012/mapping-global-impacts-all-vegetable-oils-key-sustainability-iucn-study\n\n3.) https://www.ukm.my/ipi/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/29.2009The-Environmental-Impact-of-Palm-Oil-and-Other-Vegetable-Oils.pdf\n\n\n---\n\n This factoid that other oils are more sustainable could be catastrophic for the environment. Well meaning people could be increasing environmental destruction by avoiding palm oil in favour of others.\n\nPlease, this misinformation should be rectified, otherwise environmental damage from oils will likely increase.\n\n**The solution to be more sustainable is not to boycott it, rather to try to buy products that have a ""sustainably sourced palm oil"" certificate, over ones that dont. Statistically this will help make the consumption more sustainable.**\n\nBoycotting it will make it less sustainable\n\n\nAnd please, ideally read the entire sources, esp first one, and esp the conclusion and discussion, since they go in much more detail than i have covered here, and paint a more detailed picture on the pros and cons of palm oil, how to make production more sustainable.\n\n\nThis is what we can infer from the data we have right now. As the sources say however, we need more information to better tackle this entire thing w oils. But believing claims about how ""palm oil is the most horrible and boycotting it will help the environment"" are unsubstantiated, and appear to contradict available evidence.\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nPS i edited a few points for better readability, and had pasted the wrong link (wanted to post another website defo not that) in one section, so i yeeted it."

It is a very cheap and quick dose of proteins which can be easily cometed by lentils and other legumes. \n\nMy question is: is eating every day seitan unhealthy?\n\nWe should keep in mind 4 points:\n\n1) seitan is a highly processed food since it is basically ""condensed gluten"" from wheat.\n\n2) When you eat s. you take a lot of gluten. Of course people usually eat additional sources of gluten like pasta, cereals and bread. Of course you can increase rice (or other gluten free products) reducing other gluten based foods. I don't think I am wrong but 50 g of seitan contain more gluten than 350 g of pasta/bread.\nMoreover many people claim that the quality of gluten has been decreasing since they introduced genetically modified grains (they should be called cultivar). Unfortunately I am not an expert in this field.\n\n3) When I say eating s. evey day I mean 50 g of seitan per day and I am talking about a pure seitan steak.

Can take advantage of robot delivery and pickup. Example: food delivery. Need something like, sterilized plastic tupperware or something mandated rather than throw-away containers. Can use robots to deliver to new type of service that cleans them and returns them to the restaurant."

But changing suddenly seems difficult and I want to make sure i succeed and keep the habits for long time, not just a couple of months. I think I'll start small and change 1 or 2 habits every week. My first weeks goal is to start using ink pens instead of use and throw pens to cut down unnecessary plastic waste and delete junk emails that take up serves spaces and energy. Both are aimed at reducing unnecessary contributed CO2 emissions. What are some similar small steps that I can take initially? \n\nAlso suggest some big steps that I should eventually aim towards? I have the idea that I should recycle, grow my own food, not waste, live frugal etc etc. I need it broken down into actionable steps so that it would collectively be able to checklist them and not just have them in mind and never do them.\n\nThanks for your time and efforts!!"

rg5mu6,"Some articles i needed to write for my Service &amp; Action Delaying climate mitigation action and allowing for transitory temperature overshoots necessitate large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in the second half of this century, which may have negative consequences for land, food, and ecosystems. Meanwhile, attaining climate targets without global net-negative emissions necessitates early and quick emission reduction actions, which poses immediate problems. We examine the implications of scenarios that do not rely on land-based CDR technology for land-use and food systems. Early climate action provides various benefits and trade-offs, and it prevents the need for substantial (mitigation-induced) changes in land use in the long run. Long-term benefits include cheaper food prices, a lower risk of starvation, and less demand for irrigation water. Simultaneously, near-term mitigating pressures in the agriculture, forest, and land-use sectors, as well as the required land area for energy crops, increase, leading to an increased danger of food shortages.\n\nFollowing the Kyoto Protocol, the European Union committed to reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20% below 1990 levels by 2020. Carbon dioxide is the most significant GHG. To satisfy this commitment, governments must address the sustainability problem of offsetting expanding population and wealth by dematerializing less energy per GDP and decarbonizing less carbon per energy. I examined carbon dioxide emissions from 1993 to 2004 to see if meeting the challenge was feasible. Although emissions in the Union as a whole increased by only 0.31 percent per year on average, emissions and their drivers differed significantly between the 27 member states. There was some dematerialization and decarbonization, but not enough to counteract the minor population growth and fast expanding prosperity. To complete its debt within the next 12 years, The EU27 would have to dematerialize and decarbonize 1.9–2.6 times faster than it did from 1993 to 2004 to offset its growing population and wealth. As a result, completing its duty only by reducing fossil carbon emissions is quite doubtful."

All businesses should be operating as small businesses and staffed by people who live in the town.

Stopped buying anything I do not actually need, super proud of this one because I used to buy a lot of clothes and shoes. I try to avoid going shopping under any circumstances. \n2. Get most of my books out of the library instead of accumulating new ones. This hopefully will save a tree somewhere (I read a lot), but it has the nice advantage of sticking it to Jeff Bezos and his slavery-funded penis rocket!\n3. Switched to solid soaps and shampoos. I am still on a lesrning curve with the solid shampoo, since I have quite thick hair, but I won’t go back.

I loved how both Portugal and Spain had excellent public transportation systems and recycling bins interspersed around public spaces. Aruba really surprised me bc they used paper and bamboo utensils everywhere. The grocery stores mostly had paper and bamboo utensils, cups, and plates, but sadly, they all came packaged in plastic :/ The large grocery store there made you use reusable shopping bags and charged you extra if you asked for the plastic alternative. I was kind of surprised that they didn't have reef protection initiatives in place or more protection against littering at beaches and stuff considering how much tourism they get from people coming to scuba dive and snorkel. Didn't really notice a lot of environmental strides being taken in El Salvador, but it's a bigger problem when the US doesn't do much to protect the environment considering how much Europe and the rest of the world seems to be trying.

rpvnlp,"Some studies on the life cycle environmental impacts of different kinds of drink packaging. \nHeres the first study: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348005008_Life_Cycle_Assessment_of_Beverage_Packaging/fulltext/604dd10292851c2b23c98f26/Life-Cycle-Assessment-of-Beverage-Packaging.pdf?origin=publication_detail\n\nand to quote the conclusion:\n\n""The results found that in each category there was a less impactful beverage packaging than plastic bottles. In the Pressurised Beverage Category, 100% recycled aluminium cans would be the least impactful option, in the Fruit Juice Beverage Category Tetra Pak would be the least impactful option and in the Milk Beverage Category milk cartons would be the least impactful option.""\n\n\nHeres another one done on wine containers:\n\nhttps://www.alko.fi/INTERSHOP/static/WFS/Alko-OnlineShop-Site/-/Alko-OnlineShop/fi_FI/Tavarantoimittajille/Muut/EN/Alko%20wine%20packaging%20LCA%20update_final%20report.pdf\n\n\nAnd another one on aluminum containers:\n\nhttps://www.alko.fi/INTERSHOP/static/WFS/Alko-OnlineShop-Site/-/Alko-OnlineShop/fi_FI/pdf_t/Muut%20pdf_t/Alko-Aluminium-bottle-CO2-calculation-Final-report.pdf\n\n\n------\n\nTetraPak appears the best option overall, but please read the sources, and find more. From what I've read it appears that l glass far from bring the solution, Despite the popular perception. **But Please read more And if needed challenge this conclusion.** As of now, I've read a portion of the text contents of the studies, and all of the conclusions, So I advise everyone to read the entire thing.\n\nI see so many people not checking what research says when choosing sustainable packaging and making posts about it, which has lead to people seeing glass as somehow the sustainable option. Well, for drink packging, neither of them appear to be the sustainable option.\n\nThe third Source also covers aluminium cans recycling rates across countries. This impacts the sustainability score of aluminium cans, as less recycling means significantly higher impacts.\n\n--\n\nIn light of these findings and Due to the complexity of Tetrapak packaging (several layers), I invite everyone to dig really deep on this topic. Search more. Find relevant studies both on Google and Google scholar. There might be studies linked on Wikipedia I'm pages about different kinds of packaging.\n\nWhich ever is in the end the least unsustainable, it appears to me that glass bottles are off that list.\n\n---\n\nConclusion:\n\n**As always, the most sustainable option is simply to not to buy any drinks in the shop, and instead consume tap water. This is what we should be doing more often, if your local supply isnt poisoned (arsenic or smth,)**\n\nI only drink tap water, And in addition to that there's only tetrapak milk in smallish quantities (intolerant and flexitarian). \n\nBut it really helps to take A really deep dive into topics like these, as education is the first step towards effective activism\n\n\nCheers \^^"

rtuuo4,"Sharing Sustainable Housing Plans; show me what you got! Hey everyone, newbie here.\n\nLike many of you, I'm beyond tired of the daily rise and grind at a minimum wage job that has squeezed the productivity out of me like a lemon to the point where I feel like I've been ground into a fine powder. I'm only 26 but I have been in the workforce for nearly 11 years (completely on my own not living with family since i was 14) and have absolutely nothing to show for it. I have no savings, I've never held a job that gave me benefits or a raise, and I'm currently barely scraping by in a one bedroom apartment. \n\nMy solution to this is to build a completely sustainable home where I will use as few resources as possible. I have been thinking about this for nearly 5 years and have a few mock drawings that plan out an easily built home that relies on geothermal heating and cooling, solar energy, strategic window and roof overhang placement, and geothermal walls to provide plenty of light and heat irregardless of the season and outdoor temperature. Minor adjustments can be made to these house plans to maximize efficiency in different climates. The least sustainable part of these housing plans includes the use of concrete and antifreeze liquid, which we all know contributes heavily to overall greenhouse gases put into the atmosphere and has disastrous affectson surrounding groundand underground water tables if a leak occurs, respectively.\n\nBelow is an idea of what I'm planning, but I want to see what other people are planning also! \n\nI live in the Northern hemisphere on the west coast of the United States in the PNW. \nFor an above ground home:\nI am planning this home to be about 1200 square feet with a joined kitchen and living room, full bathroom and connected laundry, a long hallway that extends past two bedrooms and leads into a south facing greenhouse which will border the homes' concrete thermal mass wall. I plan on the greenhouse capturing heat during the day year-round and slowly releasing it into the bedrooms throughout the night. Outside of the greenhouse will be deciduous trees that will block the Sun from overheating the greenhouse in the summer, while losing its leaves in the winter allowing full heat absorption for the concrete thermal mass wall. Below the flooring I will have a geothermal heating and cooling system that will consist of long thick tubes filled with an antifreeze agent that will heat or cool the home to a constant 50-60°F temperature. Extra heating or cooling will be achieved by sun lights and vents throughout the house. The roof will be a double skillion with flat gentle slopes for solar panels and room for extra windows for lighting and passive heat capture.\n\nFor an Earth sheltered home:\nA single story home with one exposed wall that will be very similar in plan to the above ground home except without the need for an antifreeze filled geothermal heating and cooling tube but will require much more concrete for stabilization. This home will also be virtually earthquake proof as well as sound proof.\n\nThere are plenty of pros and cons between an earth sheltered home and a traditional above ground home, and my future plans for building either are heavily dependent on the type of land that I can find...which is almost exclusively depending on its price. I don't have a lot of money so right now I am searching primarily for at least one acre of land, preferably with some wooded area on the property, in an area that is not extremely close to the ocean or tectonic fault lines, as well as being close enough to the city to where I can get to the hospital in time after being worst-case-scenario'ed by a cougar.\n\nI have a book list and a public YouTube playlist that I can share here to give curious people some insight as to where I'm getting all of my information.\n\nCalculate your sun position to maximize your solar efficiency [here](https://www.sunearthtools.com/dp/tools/pos_sun.php)\n\nBook list:\n- The Homeowners Guide to Renewable Energy by Dan Chiras\n- Building a Sustainable Home by Melissa Rappaport Schifman\n- Residential Energy 6th Ed. by John Krigger\n- Drafting and Design for Architecture by Dana Hepler, Paul Ross Wallach, Donald Hepler\n\nYouTube playlist [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUz6tTKgb3J2K2FdyhoxNnbUlFm54-wBN)\n\nI come here posting this for a few reasons:\n\n- I want to share information that I have gathered over the last 5 years with other people who may not have access to that information, or have even better information that we can all build upon together to maximize efficiency.\n- I have a few blind spots that I personally haven't been able to find better solutions for in my house building plans and want to put this out as a beacon for help correcting those blind spots. For example, I really don't like the amount of concrete I'm going to theoretically use in either of these builds and I really don't like the idea of putting antifreeze in a tube Underground because of my fears surrounding leakage and poisoning underground water resources or the land.\n- I firmly believe that free information sharing is going to be a great way in the future for people to take their own lives into their own hands not only for better quality of life purposes but also to help us all become better stewards of our environment. Of course giant corporations going around spilling tons of sewage and garbage into local watersheds will never be outweighed by a few people living completely sustainably, but while governments drag their feet on putting pro-earth laws into action this can be a way to feel like you have some control over your own carbon footprint as an individual. \n\nIf you read this entire book worth of rambling out of me, congratulations. What I want most out of this post is to hear what you plan for sustainability in your own home. If you are making any renovations to your home to make it more sustainable, if you have worked on other people's homes to increase sustainability, if you understand how solar panels work and want to share that information (it's hard info to sink in, for me!) please feel free to share. You never know who could come across this thread and pick up some valuable information that they didn't have before!"

rwmqld,"Maybe we shouldn’t live sustainably \n\n\n\nLet me be clear, i genuinely thought we should stop climate change at first. I am not a troll, or some kind of weirdo. I’m also a vegan activist.\nBefore you start reading: be aware that our desire to live is also biological, not entirely objective. Once you realize that, you can be open minded to the idea that non existence is not that bad.\nHere is why I think one shouldn’t be a climate activist, and shouldn’t make an effort to live a green lifestyle. But the only effort one should make if he wants to do good, is to be anti climate activist. in order to help climate change do it’s thing). I suppose I have had this thought for at least one year, in the darkest deepest part of my mind: the world is full with endless suffering. Therefore, It would be better if life didn’t exist on earth at all.\nNow two things:\n• we couldn’t destroy all life on earth even if we tried. We got animals here that can even survive in the outer space for a few years, so that’s off the table.\n• if humans weren’t on earth, it would be undoubtedly the best thing that could ever happen. And that’s part of the reason why I want climate change to take over the world(to fully or almost fully extinct all humans). A new better world will be born from the ashes of the climate apocalypse. A world free from humans(that create the most suffering on earth, so much that we can’t even imagine). And the apocalypse might even be worth the suffering it will cause to humans and animals.\nI know that animals will die and suffer horribly, and that they will be affected first. But remember, the apocalypse will be an extremely short era in earth’s history, which means that it’s close range consequences will be nothing compared to its long range consequences, which will be good.\nMost of the avoidable unnecessary victims of now are victims of humans. And yes, the victims of the climate apocalypse will be victims as well. However they will be gone for a good reason for a change.\nAnd it doesn’t really matter who will have to be extinct or be affected first, by the apocalypse. Please notice that I have the perfect reason not to have value of life anymore. The life in the wild must be too bad to consider them as good, therfore it’s not a big loss if a lot of animals die. I’d consider to extinct all life from earth if I could. Animals in the wild suffer from hunger, injuries, weather. One day i saw that poor cat I saw outside, and then realized that there are a lot cats like him. They absolutely must extremely suffer from the rain and cold. Most of us western humans dont know and don’t have to experience even 10% of this pain, because we are so far from this survival situation, thanks to unbelievably accessible and high technology. Now think about all the insects, and ants. Every drop of rain can cause them the most long and painful death. They must be terrified. And this is only a very little example. This is why I don’t think it a loss of animal life on earth will be reduced due to the climate(life is not that good, even bad).\nby the way, believe me, I am well aware of horrible consequences of not stopping climate change, to both humans and non humans. And it does make sad not less that it makes you. But I think I really have the perfect reason to be sure that it will be worth it, for the greater good.\nThere is a high possibility that it will prevent more suffering than it will create. Keep in mind, if we killed humans in the pace we kill animals, it would take maybe. A week until we were all dead. Earth now is already a huge intensive consistent factory of suffering, because of humans. We could  cancel  most of this factory for at least 100000 years. All it takes is just few especially intense decades of suffering, and that’s it. I know the cost is exteremly painful, but overall it worths it great deal\n\nPlease tell me your notes and your position. I’d also like to hear your arguments if you don’t agree with me."

rwxpvd,"Question about ""plastic credits"" A supplier of mine recently touted that they are ""plastic neutral"". Which surprised me since they create disposable plastics for medical use. Apperantly they buy ""plastic credits"" from a company called Plastic bank ([https://plasticbank.com/](https://plasticbank.com/)) which cleans up plastic from the ocean and sells a ""credit"" for each ton of waste so other companies can ""offset"" their plastic production. \n\nWhile surely a good way to finance ocean clean-up (the more you clean up, the more money you can make). I can't but help seeing this as accounting magic. After all, my supplier is still selling non-biodegradable disposable plastic. But now claims it's ""neutral"" towards the environment because they funded the cleaning of someone else's plastic waste? Will someone clean up their waste and sell a credit to the company who's waste was taken out of the ocean? (talk about circular economy)\n\nAm I missing something here? Or is it legit?"

rxnl61,"Going Green About a year ago I purchased GOTS cotton boxer briefs and socks. After much research I started wearing less polyester/synthetics and going more cotton for basics. I purchased some regular cotton basics as well. Lately, I have the urge to go GOTS certified for just about everything. However, this is obviously expensive and will take time to build a solid wardrobe. I used to wash all my Pact clothing together, now I mixed everything to save energy and water. So what I’m wondering is how much chemicals from my regular cottons are transfer into my expensive organic cottons. I plan to purchase more but I don’t want to be wasteful and throw away any of the regular cotton shirts I’ve bought. Does washing   Regular cotton and GOTs cotton really ruin the certified stuff? I’m talking about chemicals from dyes and pesticides mainly. Should I just continue washing the clothes I’ve had together and start to wash only GOTS stuff together? It seems like a grey area honestly and to have enough for a full load… I mean I’m no mathematician but it’s gonna be a few more hundred dollars until I have enough to make it separate. Anyone else have this issue? If so, any suggestions? Should I start washing the regular with regular and gots with gots? Would really appreciate some good input. Google isn’t helpful at all in this case…."
