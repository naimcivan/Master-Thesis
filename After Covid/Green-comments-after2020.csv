ffwvxyv,evog28,"Check out this 30 minute talk from GOTO Berlin 2019 by Jessica Greene, software engineer at Ecosia. I've dropped the full talk bio below:\n\nEcosia like Google is a search engine, however we use our profits to plant trees world wide. This year we celebrated our users contributing to over 50 Million trees being planted in 15 countries from Ghana to Colombia, achieved through working with 22 individual partner projects. When the goal is to use the majority of profits to plant trees, engineering decisions need to connect the user directly to that purpose. Ecosia provides a platform that fits the users needs while allowing them to make sustainable choices and bring awareness with the tech they use.\n\nThis talk will discuss how Ecosia develops features that create a connection between users and the tree planting projects they fund, allowing them to feel that personal sense of achievement and participation. Let's delve into how we can build tech solutions that change the world!\n\n**What will the audience learn from this talk?**  \nThe audience will learn about the work Ecosia is doing to connect our users to their real world impact through the use of our search engine and how everyday tech solutions can be used for combating climate change.\n\n**Does it feature code examples and/or live coding?**  \nPossibly some small code examples in a slide but not live coding or running code.",1580312248,t3_evog28,/r/Green/comments/evog28/how_can_everyday_tech_solutions_be_used_for/ffwvxyv/

fhai0ee,f1xa6q,"That is an excellent and much-needed criticism of some botched studies that climate change denialists love to parade around to pretend that renewables are useless. The author does focus too much on gas-to-power, and not enough on the fact that it's not the end of the world if we got to only 80% renewable and sometimes fire up the old fossil fuel power plants when renewables can't quite handle the demand. There won't be any cost to build those plants - they are the ones we already have. Further, he doesn't make much mention of the ways we can control the output from hydro power, and the use of pumped hydro for storage. The focus on the balance between over-provisioning of renewables and storage is perfect, and it's an aspect that so many studies just don't bother to get right.\n\nThese extra options may only handle the last 10% or 20% of the demand peak, but extra bit has a big effect on costs.",1581411535,t3_f1xa6q,/r/Green/comments/f1xa6q/correcting_antirenewable_energy_propaganda/fhai0ee/

fi92qch,f6z3zn,"These are fine concerns so I’m glad to address them. \n\nTransportation - most especially ground transportation - has a relatively low carbon footprint since the USPS/UPS fleet is highly efficient and carries many items per truckload. If you look at a garment’s lifecycle impacts, transportation is one of the smallest impacts, unless it’s shipped by airfreight. We only ship by ground for that reason. But I’ll be using all proceeds to purchase offsets, so as long as items are sellable, it will be carbon negative.\n\nI will sort through the shipped clothes to see what is still wearable -- I'll sell those and use the money to offset carbon emissions. For the other items, I'll donate (if they're in good enough condition) or send them to Springclean, a nonprofit in North Carolina (run by a friend) to create local jobs and enable the local artist community there. And for the items in really poor conditions, I have two fiber recycling partners.\n\nBasically the goal is to get the most sustainable use from them.\n\nThen about the prices - you’re right that the prices on the site are high so I’ll need to change them. The products on the site just launched so the prices are still tbd. I estimated that the average income for each sale will be around $10 to factor in the costs of shipping and sorting, and, for items that can’t be resold (which may be many of them), sending to donation or fiber recycling. \n\nDoes that answer your questions. Understand the skepticism but my goal here is to bring items and materials back into circulation without a carbon impact.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and for what it’s worth to illustrate my green credentials, I’ve been reviewing some brands’ sustainable/ethical claims to determine if they’re likely accurate or possibly greenwashing. You can see those here:\n\nhttps://wearendless.com/greenwashing-or-real\n\nI’ve mostly posted those on r/ethicalfashion \n\nBut to take it a step further, some brands began asking for a roadmap to be more sustainable, so I built this Brand Sustainability Maturity Model. There are certainly opportunities to further improve, but you can find the detailed draft here:\n\nhttps://wearendless.com/brand-maturity\n\nAnyway, like I said, my goal with this is to bring items and fibers back into circulation without a carbon impact. Hope you can get onboard with the concept even if you’re uncertain about the benefits.\n\nPS: I love reddit for these conversations - it’s such a clear court of public opinion.",1582254165,t1_fi90cxr,/r/Green/comments/f6z3zn/do_you_have_clothing_youre_not_wearing_ill/fi92qch/

fjds61q,fcvjnl," \*\*Well, it was just the text of article for those who didn't want to navigate out of the sub:\n\nTwo recent articles highlight an understandable concern in the mainstream media about the rise of “eco-fascism”: first in *Harper’s Bazaar*, [The Eco-Fascists Are Coming](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a30086064/climate-change-eco-fascists/); second in the *New York Times*, [White Supremacy Goes Green](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/opinion/sunday/far-right-climate-change.html). The term “eco-fascist” appeared on the radar of many folks when the lunatic shooter in Christchurch, New Zealand—who murdered 51 innocent Muslims—[described himself as such in his manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch_mosque_shootings#Manifesto). But is the term “eco-fascist” always being used wisely?\n\nThe *Harper’s Bazaar* article has the sub-headline of “When Republicans eventually stop denying climate change, they’ll start doing something much worse,” and spends a good deal of time discussing Trump’s climate denial and environmental failures, and how he is basically letting people die because of his climate policies and inaction. This is a fair point to make. The article then discusses “lifeboat ethics” as an example of fascism in an ecological context, which argues that there will not be room for everyone on the lifeboat of environmental survival. The argument seems to be that Trump is a fascist, he doesn’t care about anyone, and when the Republicans finally accept climate change they will become eco-fascists. The term “eco-fascist” is not actually discussed in the article and is used only once: in the article title.\n\nThe *New York Times* article shows how those on the far right have co-opted various environmental tropes to further their political agenda, and notes how the ecological movement has shared some territory with the far right in the past. The article is not so interested in the term “eco-fascist,” rather the strategy of white supremacists mobilizing ecological issues. However, the article then alludes to these white supremacists seeking “openings for authoritarianism,” suggesting that authoritarianism is inevitably fascist. The article also does its bit to bring Trump and Fox News into the discussion, tainting them by fascist association.\n\nWhat both these articles demonstrate is a certain slippage in the use of the term “eco-fascist” and “far right.” Fascism is never adequately defined, and consequently other issues—such as authoritarianism, party political point scoring, or any uncomfortable discussions—are collapsed into this term. Denouncing someone as “eco-fascist” can then be easily used to shut down good faith conversations about challenging solutions to the environmental crisis rather than engaging with them in equally good faith.\n\nLet’s try and get a bit of consensus on the terms “fascist” and “eco-fascist” so that such good faith conversations are not so easily derailed. In his widely-cited book, *The Anatomy of Fascism*, Robert Paxton defines fascism like this:\n\n""Fascism may be defined as a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victim-hood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.""\n\nIt is not so easy to find a widely-cited definition of “eco-fascist,” with much of the discussion existing in opinion-based journalism, which has all of the problems discussed above. However, here is a definition from Bron Taylor’s well-respected *The Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature*:\n\n""we may define “ecofascism” as a totalitarian government that requires individuals to sacrifice their interests to the well-being and glory of the “land,” understood as the splendid web of life, or the organic whole of nature, including peoples and their states. The land acquires mystical properties as the sacred source and absolute measure for all things. Polluting the land, either by toxins or by admitting the wrong kind of immigrants, not only threatens the state’s stability and security, but also affronts the sacred natural order itself. Even though the web of life supposedly admits of no hierarchies, ecofascism requires leaders who enforce “natural” principles against selfish (hence, unnatural) individuals and peoples. Militarism, expansionism, and possibly racism are required to defend the land – Fatherland, Mother Earth, Gaia – from those who disrespect the land, including both industrialized countries and overpopulated “developing” nations.""\n\nWhen people are inclined to denounce others with the term “eco-fascist,” it should really be done with regard to such definitions. **Does the proposed solution or movement tick the majority—if not all—of the boxes from the above definitions in either practice or aspiration? If no, then it is likely that the term is being misapplied.** In this context, authoritarianism cannot be considered fascist unless it is applied in a very specific way that ticks the majority of the boxes in the above definitions. The same can be said for difficult discussions about population and immigration: if these issues are viewed via a lens of sustainability rather than racial or national supremacy, they cannot honestly be described as fascist.\n\nUltimately, misapplying the term “eco-fascist” results in two related dangers. First, when progressives try and shut down discussions by denouncing someone as an eco-fascist, they also shut down the possible solutions proposed in those discussions. Now, it might be that those proposed solutions were only ever a thin veil for some unsavory racist agenda, in which case they would have been exposed as such as the discussions unfolded. But it might equally be that **progressives paint themselves into a corner, closing themselves off to what in time will be shown to be the only viable political and scientific solutions available to course-correct the environmental crisis**.\n\nThis leads to a second danger. If people see that genuine potential solutions are being shut down by progressives through the overuse of the term “eco-fascist,” **they may be inclined to have more sympathy for the one group of people who are open to having those discussions: genuine eco-fascists**. As such, it is possible that “radicalization” could happen not so much because of how issues are represented by the Right, rather how they are *misrepresented* by the Left.\n\nIf you find yourself triggered by this discussion and are worried that it sounds too much like opening a door to the far right, please take a moment. **Challenge your assumptions. Think strategically rather than emotionally**.",1583258201,t1_fjdq9gx,/r/Green/comments/fcvjnl/when_is_it_right_to_denounce_someone_as_an/fjds61q/

Now, looking at hydro power, it's a zero-emissions source of electricity to power the things we use every day, like Reddit. It's also used as an energy storage method for intermittent renewables: while extra energy is generated by sun and wind it can pump water uphill then flow down later when the sun/wind aren't around. Now, I applaud the desire not to externalize costs onto other ecosystems. Hydro prevents air pollution and allows us to use energy while creating no GHGs. But what about the local river ecosystem? Great question. Let's address that question while we continue to use hydro power until we no longer have to deal with the most pressing issues, climate change and air pollution.

fkvy321,fkhgi2,"**Planck's principle**\n\nIn sociology of scientific knowledge, Planck's principle is the view that scientific change does not occur because individual scientists change their mind, but rather that successive generations of scientists have different views.\n\nThis was formulated by Max Planck in 1950:\n\nA new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it. . . . \n\nAn important scientific innovation rarely makes its way by gradually winning over and converting its opponents: it rarely happens that Saul becomes Paul. What does happen is that its opponents gradually die out, and that the growing generation is familiarized with the ideas from the beginning: another instance of the fact that the future lies with the youth.\n\n***\n\n**Eight-hour day**\n\nThe eight-hour day movement or 40-hour week movement, also known as the short-time movement, was a social movement to regulate the length of a working day, preventing excesses and abuses. It is claimed it had its origins in the Industrial Revolution in Britain, where industrial production in large factories transformed working life. At that time, the working day could range from 10 to 16 hours, the work week was typically six days a week and the use of child labour was common. Robert Owen had raised the demand for a ten-hour day in 1810, and instituted it in his socialist enterprise at New Lanark.\n\n***\n\n^([ )[^(PM)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space)^( | )[^(Exclude me)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme)^( | )[^(Exclude from subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/Green/about/banned)^( | )[^(FAQ / Information)](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)^( | )[^(Source)](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v0.28)",1584579178,t1_fkvy2nd,/r/Green/comments/fkhgi2/if_you_have_a_sane_society_then_people_will_feel/fkvy321/

flcvetl,fo1zi0,"Ok. Let's go with that analogy. So, it's like a battery where the  charging side is geographically separate from the discharging side (the fuel cell). In this analogy the charging side is the electolizer that converts renewable electricity to chemical energy (in the form of hydrogen). This electrolizer/charging side can be located where the renewable energy is abundant and potentially very cheap (like Australia for example). So cheap solar from miles away (eg the other side of the world) could compete on price with more expensive renewable energy that is more local to where the vehicle is used (in the case of BEVs). Whether the economics work out, is therefore more than just a question of straight ""energy efficiency"". \n\nAdditionally, there are the advantages that filling is lightning quick in comparison to charging a BEV. Also, the hydrogen fuel is very light in comparison to batteries. For cars, this us not enough of an advantage over BEVs, so BEVs are winning out there. But for high power, heavy duty, long range applications the necessary batteries will be too heavy, and the charging limes too high. So hydrogen is definitely a good option for things like trucks, trains, buses, ships, and aircraft.\n\nAs for the instability angle. I think of it this way. An energy reservoir for a particular vehicle range requires a certain amount of energy, whether that is in the form of a tank of petrol, lpg, hydrogen or lithium batteries. All of these energy storage vessels can ignite, and, as I've said, they would each (in the same vehicle) contain broadly similar amounts of energy to burn. Hydrogen has the advantage of dispersing upwards into the atmosphere quite quickly in the case of a leak, because it is so buoyant.\n\nFinal point. Hydrogen is potentially better for the environment than lithium, in term of cleanup. Lithium battery waste is, in my personal view, the next ""plastic panic"", just waiting to happen. Sure the  manufacturers will  do their best to recycle, but once BEVs are ubiquitous, it will only take a small percentage of irresponsible disposal to create a significant pollution problem",1585048134,t1_flcriuc,/r/Green/comments/fo1zi0/elon_musk_may_hate_hydrogen_fuel_but_toyota_is/flcvetl/

In Nevada, the state government refused to allow waste to be brought to the long term storage facility that the federal government arranged to build there.\n\nRecently there was a story in science news about the weird problem of marking a buried nuclear waste facility so that its purpose could be understood by people many centuries or millenia from now.  It certainly seems like long term waste storage remains a major issue.\n\nI am also skeptical of how desperately we need a near term solution.

Fukushima showed us, that we can't plan for everything. Uranium reactors will always carry the risk of rendering entire continents inhabitable. If something like this should come to pass, Covid 19 would look like a bit of an inconvenience compared to the incomprehensible suffering that would follow for generations. \n\nIf the melted Chernobyl core had burned hot enough to eat through the basement of the facility and all the way through to the groundwater below, it's possible that an explosion would have followed that I can't describe with words. Suffice to say I would not be writing this, because my parents would have been killed or at least unable to have children. And my family is from Germany. \n\nAnd there is of course the question of what to do with the nuclear waste. The only real solution to that problem is to shoot that mess into space and that is currently just to expensive to do for the amounth of waste that is produced in an uranium reactor. (I hope we will be able to do that with all of the already produced waste though. Highly unlikely, but I can't help it.)\n\nSo, no. I think we should retire uranium reactors for good. (Before they quite literally fucking kill all of us. No thanks, Satan.)\n\nHowever, I think we should invest in continued research of thorium reactors. \n\nAll the problems above aren't present in thorium reactors or at least much less dangerous. That is, as far as we currently know.\n\nThe thorium fuel-cycle produces only a fraction of the waste produced by the uranium cycle and (most of) the waste products is no longer dangerous after a couple hundred years rather than a couple of ten-thousands. \n\nIt's much harder to produce material for nulear weapons with a thorium reactor. \n\nCompared to uranium, thorium is ridiculously abundant, easier to mine, doesn't need to be enriched, though it needs to be pre-processed and it's much, much more energy-dense.\n\nLastly, and most importantly, it's probably a lot less likely to blow up in our faces and kill billions. \n\nBut the hype is real, so here are some myths on thorium debunked: https://whatisnuclear.com/thorium-myths.html\n\nWe simply don't know enough.

fuoeyc5,h7l02n,"So with a simple string of one panel connected to another the weakest panel reduces the capacity of the whole string.  So if you have 10 panels and one is reduced to 5% the entire string is only producing 5% each.   If you have shade going across part of a string, that whole string is being limited. \n\nThe way this is avoided is with MLPEs or module level power equipment, and there are two main companies that do this, Enphase and Solar-Edge, but they use different approaches. For both they attach too the back of each panel(really to the rail not the panel but that's just semantics). \n\nSolar-edge basically has a smart sensor on it that reads the power output of the panel and only connects each panel to the string if it's producing over 85% power, otherwise it's bypassed and this keeps your strings producing at a higher level.  \n\nEnphase puts micro-inverters on the back of each panel, creating a string of AC producing devices that connect down to your house. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe end result is the same, you generate more power and if one fails, exactly like you said, you only lose a small portion of your overall production.  And both systems have monitoring, when you install each one you scan a code for each device and place it on a map in their respective software, that way if a device fails you know exactly where to go to pull it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor SolarRoof these devices are too expensive, and instead they rely on Diodes, one diode for every 4 (maybe 6 now) tiles. You can see a picture of the trunk cable with diodes in the imgur link above.  If a tile fails, it's diode will fail and turn off the power for those 4 or 6 tiles in the branch.  It works similar to the other systems mentioned above, but with no smart monitoring.  And it will connect to the system at 50% capacity of all the tiles not a higher percentage like most MLPEs.   And since there is no monitoring if there is a problem you don't know where it is, and have to pull all the tiles along the trunk cable to test the diodes and see where your bad panel is, then pull all 3 or 4 of those panels to determine which one is failed. \n\nThat was probably way more of an answer than you wanted... but there you go.

Still work in the industry for a different racking company now.",1592026745,t1_fuo9ce4,/r/Green/comments/h7l02n/tesla_is_now_canceling_1000_deposit_preorders_of/fuoeyc5/

fv106af,ha4h5j,"A few things about this ad\n\n$300/square foot is pretty expensive.   In my neck of the woods, builder grade, according to the insurance people is $170/sq ft.  $300/sq ft would be pretty high end, and 500sq ft. is barely bigger than a similarly priced RV.    \n\n\nWith a budget of $300/sq ft, you'd have plenty of money left over after building builder grade or slightly better for solar panels.\n\nThe vast bulk of the insulation in my house is cellulose.   Some of it new, a couple years ago when I redid my roof and added 2' of insulation to the attic, I bought big bags of cellulose, essentially old shredded newspapers or I imagine ""denim"" and blew it in there.   It was cheaper and nicer than fiberglass (sand and recycled glass)  or foam.    The house is 100 years old, and digging into some old walls, I found the same kind of stuff in the walls.\n\n1940's houses weren't built to the standards dictated by code today.   They were a bit more like garages today.   A garage today can be built for $30k.  A 1940's house would have a couple interior walls,  4 plumbing fixtures a couple more windows, wall coverings, but be essentially similar in size and level of complexity as a new garage today.   The big expense in house building for modern houses is the size, and the number of bathrooms, plumbing fixtures, outlets, cabinets, etc. \n\n\nBuilding 4 walls and a roof is easy, the time and expense is in the finishing.   Pre-finished panels are great, but, they don't address the details that take the time and money like the plumbing, electrical, and appliances people expect to have in homes.     A new furnace and AC unit costs thousands, in 1940 HVAC wasn't much more complex than an iron box with a pipe that went to a chimney.    \n\n1940's construction was also a lot more labor intensive.   Imagine hand cutting and nailing every single piece of lathe on the walls, then covering it in a smooth coat of mud, vs. sheetrock.    Lots of building pieces today are ""pre-fabricated"" like that plaster is sandwiched between two pieces of paper at the factory instead of having to to do it on site like they used to.\n\nI remember reading about some 20th century blizzard on the prairie, and accounts of snow building up around the cracks inside houses.   That doesn't happen anymore, plastic might play a role there although I imagine factory machining of sheeting might help too.  Plastic is bad, but, so is wasting fuel on heat.    It's both petro-chemicals, and the stuff in the walls saves more than it's weight in what goes out the chimney.   \n\nThis seems like people trying to sell gussied up trailer homes at a premium with buzzwords.

fvbfrpq,hbhqsf,"Awesome. The context is that the UK rail network is mostly 120 years old and was not really built with enough space for modern trains, let alone electric overhead wires. It's ok to put them in in rolling fields, but tunnels, bridges, city centers, high viaducts ect - it's very difficult and expensive to do. It also means impacts on the availability of that train line for people when you've got it closed to install more wires or later for inspectioning and maintaining them.\n\nHydrogen trains are much simpler in terms of infrastructure. Main disadvantage is the overhead wires work really really well for connecting up renewables along the route and allow the trains to be used as capacitors/load balancers.

Any attempt to convince people to use less A/C, eat less meat, stop driving, stop flying...these are impossible to achieve.  It has never happened and will never happen on a large enough scale.  We need to look at alternative solutions.  People won't stop driving cars so we make electric vehicles.  People won't stop eating meat so we develop plant-based meat.  Add in some suggestive taxation and incentives, and people will naturally change their behavior.\n\nRenewable energy holds the capacity to supply all the electrical requirements of heat pumps with very few carbon emissions.  And changing refrigerants to use CO2 instead of current refrigerants like CFCs and HFCs would be *a hundred and fifty times better* for the environment.  Make the grid renewable, and ban high-emitting refrigerants, and you'll eliminate almost all of the A/C problem.\n\nThough, as another commenter mentioned, the heat bubble effect will still exist.

fyk6169,htzg18,"Great that you are thinking about improving the environment! It really depends on a number of different factors but in general electric cars are more environmentally friendly.\n\n1. **Battery chemistry.** Different batteries contain different amounts of rare earths and metals. The environmental impact comes from the extraction of the resources on the one side and the longevity and recyclability on the other hand. Afaik, Tesla has the most advanced battery chemistry, here (best resource use and longevity. Recycling is making progress but still far from sufficient. Even without massive batteries, gas cars still use rare earths and metals in other parts (i.e. catalyst). Recycling still depends heavily.\n2. **Production**. Here, most electric care manufacturers are in the process or already use 100% renewable energy for assembly. In gas car production that is more the exemption than the rule. It has to be taken into account that the battery production makes an electric car still more energy-intensive to produce than a gas car. This turns around after 40.000 to 75.000 km depending on the cars in question, though.\n3. **Driving and Charging.** When driving, the electric car will always be more environmentally friendly. Even if you would only use electricity generated from gas, you would get more miles per hour out of it in the electric car when compared with a gas car directly combusting the same amount. Clean energy is naturally better, however. The efficiency of electric cars varies widely.\n4. **Air quality.** As electric cars don't produce any exhaust and far less particulate matter, they are superior from on the first km in this metric.\n5. **Repairability.** As electric cars have far fewer (moveable) parts than gas cars, they usually require far fewer repairs, thereby causing less waste. However, some electric car producers are going in the direction of Apple, making it incredibly difficult and expensive to carry out simple repairs (the same goes for gas manufacturers like Mercedes or BMW, though).\n6. **Digitalization.** Spearheaded by Tesla, a lot of electric cars are becoming more and more a software-oriented product, too. This (might) bring along some positive effects for the environment, too. On the one hand, you have over-the-air-updates, which can contribute to the longevity of a car. On the other hand, once full self-driving is achieved, more people can share a car, reducing the need of the number of cars on the street.\n7. **Further Considerations.** No car is better for the environment than a car. A smaller car is better than a bigger one. Fewer trips are better than more. An electric truck might, therefore, be worse than a gas Smart (2 person city car). Considering the same car, the electric car always wins (if it is used for more than 50.000km). An electric bicycle or motorcycle might be an alternative for many.\n8. **Alternatives.** Depending on your use-case and budget, there are ways to support the environment besides buying a new electric car. When you only drive a little or need a car for a short amount of time, it might make sense to get a used gas car and thereby lengthening its lifecycle a bit. This might sound counterintuitive, but in the short-term, it saves a car from the scrapyard and saves the energy needed to produce another one. Additionally, there are okay used electric car offers by now. Additionally, it might make sense to look into (plug-in)-hybrids. I.e. when you only drive around 20-40km per day and mostly in the city, you might never use the gas engine. Also, it might help against range anxiety. In general, fully electric cars are far superior when it comes to their driving abilities and environmental friendliness though. \n\nI hope this will help you with your buying decision. Feel free to ask me any further questions you have. Personally, I think Tesla's Model 3 is the best electric car offer on the market atm.",1595168304,t3_htzg18,/r/Green/comments/htzg18/electric_vehicles_actually_good/fyk6169/

fykq2j0,htzg18,"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/so-exactly-how-much-electricity-does-take-produce-gallon-paul-martin\n\nElon Musk says the electricity used to make a gallon of gas will run his electric car 20 miles.   The author of the above article accesses that at about 3.2.    \n\nAnother factor, is that lithium is not yet recycled.   That battery is freshly mined and will go back to fill.   \n\nI look at dollar signs in this, thinking less expensive is better for the environment.  A new electric car is like $30k, where a new gas car is like $20k.     That extra third cost means it's taking an extra third materials, manufacturing, etc. to make it.   Profits etc play a role, but I think these earlier electric cars are being sold with much less profit to get them moved.\n\nThe electric car is cheaper to run, so by my cheaper is better for the environment thinking, that's good, except that the $10k difference in price will take a decade to make up.    The other factor there is the taxation, that gasoline carries a lot more tax than electricity, in order to pay for the roads.   If you take taxation out of the picture, I'd wonder if gasoline would still be cheaper. \n\nFactoring in the maintenance, gasoline cars need a little maintenance frequently, where an electric car instead of hitting you up for an $50 oil change every 10k miles and timing belt every 50k,  is going to save it up for a $2000 battery at 100k.    \n\nI think it's good to buy the electric, like we need to start moving toward that, but I don't think it's quite a panacea.    \n\nE-bikes are mad cool.  Cheap to buy, cheap to run and need less space as far as roads and parking.    That 2.1kwh mentioned in the article would run an e-bike 20 miles like Elon claims.    The smaller scale of them is going to make them better.   Cars have gotten too huge, 2 tons to move one person is ridiculous.   It'd be nice to scale those back, but there's too much focus on life safety to let that happen.",1595179480,t3_htzg18,/r/Green/comments/htzg18/electric_vehicles_actually_good/fykq2j0/

Unless you're doing that it is better to not burn the gas.\n\nThink about it this way: if you get 30 mpg and drive 150,000 miles, that's 5000 gallons of gas.  5000 gallons of gas weighs 14.8 *tonnes*, WAAAY more than your car, and it produces over *54 tonnes* of CO2.

g07gzp7,i2ubvj,"In  the past we have discussed the supporting argument for online activism  inasmuch as it supposedly “raises awareness,” with the consequent  assumption that this somehow translates into real life action. This  assumption is highly contestable: [one study](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM17/paper/viewFile/15559/14835)  of “slacktivism” concluded that “slacktivist actions, unlike those by  dedicated activists, do not encourage others, and if anything,  discourage them”; [another study](https://www.sociologicalscience.com/structure-online-activism/) concludes with reference to “an illusion of activism rather than facilitating the real thing.”\n\nBut  I also want to share a real-life story about my own “peak experience”  of online visibility and the real-world actions that resulted. A few  years ago a project I was involved with received some coverage in an  up-and-coming media outlet. The founder of this outlet is something of a  social media influencer and she shared the link to this coverage on her  facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn pages: in total, this represented  exposure to around 10 million followers. What do you think the  real-world results were of this expensive-if-you-bought-it exposure? **In short, nothing. No discernable increase in web traffic or social media followers. Not one single email query**. Even this kind of golden online visibility has very little real-world consequences.\n\nAll of this online discussion and awareness-building we do counts for little (mostly, nothing at all). **If  you want to create change you have to forcefully make it happen in real  life: literally on the streets and in the buildings of our civic  institutions**.\n\nDon’t let your efforts stop at online activity: take the first step and [fill in the Green Militia/Environmental Corps survey](https://forms.gle/CivDSdF9AFJePkaB6) so we can try and make stuff happen for real.",1596462902,t3_i2ubvj,/r/Green/comments/i2ubvj/green_militiaenvironmental_corps_a_quick_survey/g07gzp7/

g0htv6y,i49b2n,"This is exactly what happened to me. I used to be a liberal capitalist - all I wanted was more recycling, cap and trade, carbon taxes, better regulations and maybe some subsidies for renewables and more energy-efficient technology. I would cringe when people said 'you can't have infinite growth on a finite planet' because it misunderstands the definition of growth used in economics which is not conceptually related to resource throughput. I slowly became increasingly disaffected and radical as I learned more about the extent of our ecological crises.\n\nI remember reading some book - I forget the title - written by a mainstream liberal environmentalist who was talking about what policies needed to be enacted within the 'planetary boundaries model' and they were so milquetoast I started getting angry. 'Well, this problem is too bad to do anything about any more, so we'll just have to hope we can make minor political adjustments to improve things.' The dawning realisation of the poverty of ideas, the ignorance of the severity of our problems and the superficiality of concern typical of most liberal environmentalists made me hunger for other perspectives.\n\nI discovered Nicolas Georgescu-Rogan's work on entropy in economics. It is intruiging and I recommend it for those with an interest in economics. Perhaps it is a little eccentric and requires some refinement, but it is also worth reading as counterpoint to the 'weak sustainability' economists - Stiglitz and Solow, who are representatives of the mainstream thinking amongst neoclassical economists. It is astonishing how they expound such breathtaking nonsense with completely straight faces. They believe that *all* capital is perfectly inter-substitutable - i.e. resource depletion can be compensated for entirely by technological innovation, ""human capital"", etc. and therefore we don't need to care about the natural world. If that is how barren the ideas of the orthodox economists are, heterodox ideas are worth exploring. Georgescu-Rogan's work also influenced the Club of Rome and the 'Limits to Growth' books which also got me thinking along different lines - maybe eternal economic growth is possible on paper, but in reality there has *never* been any absolute decoupling of growth from resource depletion. There is also Jevons' paradox and Khazoom-Brookes postulate that the effect of increasing efficiency (in energy, in resource use) is generally to *increase* total usage of that resource as demand increases. The implications of all this are quite simply that techno-fixes and efficiency-savings are highly unlikely enough: we need to constrain demand and consumption directly.\n\nHerman Daly's 'steady-state' economics builds on many of these ideas. By the time I had moved that far there was no real overriding reason for me to remain wedded to capitalism. The kinds of economic institutions and policies that would be required in an ecologically sustainable society would differ so radically from actually existing capitalism that, even if markets were retained in some form, it would be meaningless to refer to it still as the same kind of economic system.\n\nI also became interested in the ideas of E. F. Schumacher - the idea that over-industrialisation and its concommitant large-scale institutions are an important source of our ecological problems (and much else besides - our alienation, our inability to exercise meaningful control over our lives, etc.) I am not so radical that I want a society based entirely on village communes, nor am I sure that 'small' always means most ecological, even if it does mean 'beautiful'. Nevertheless, the ideas of 'human-scale' institutions and technologies appeals to me.\n\nI had been interested in socialism as a teenager and, although I had been disappointed with the quality of much economic (and ecological) thinking amongst socialists (hence my later liberalism), I revisited the question. One of the chief advantages from the perspective of political ecology of thinking like a socialist is that it forces one to ask much broader political and institutional questions about the nature of capitalism. With the ideological fog of capitalism cleared away I began to see how deeply embedded the growth imperative is in capitalism - it is driven into the profit-motive and the financial institutions that must service capital. Not only this - we cannot divorce politics and ideology from economics. I am still not a Marxist, but the Marxists are quite right that the economic base of capitalism inevitably goes along with a certain political and ideological superstructure. This is the crucial point, I think, missed by ecological reformists who imagine that we can tinker with capitalism around the edges until it is compatible with sustainability. There is such a thing as a capitalist class and the evidence that they will not tolerate ecological measures that conflict with their interests is before us in each unfolding ecological disaster. Nor is it easy to fit the square peg of ecological values - sustainability, concern for nature, anti-materialism, human-scale societies - in the round hole of capitalism and its restless, acquisitive, materialistic, consumerist value-system.\n\nI find it amusing and infuriating in equal measure when right-wingers complain that 'greens don't really care about climate change, they are just using it to promote socialism'. The truth is quite the opposite, at least in my case: capitalists are creating a small socialist revival as many of us concerned first of all with ecological issues are being radicalised by the abysmal, world-endangering failure of capitalism to even begin to address its profound ecological problems.",1596665788,t3_i49b2n,/r/Green/comments/i49b2n/anyone_else_feel_like_they_grow_more_leftist_in/g0htv6y/

g0iijtp,i49b2n,"One of the biggest factors that pushed me towards anarchism was when I realized that I had been thinking of environmentalism as a secondary long-term issue for way too long; eventually when we keep putting it off and working against climate change bit by bit it'll be an immediate problem that we have no choice but to treat with the same urgency we treat foreign policy/social reform with, if not more urgency. COVID has absolutely been a short-term reflection of how things are gonna go with climate change if we continue under the current system: the people in charge will deny or ignore the obvious fact that there's a problem, and only when it's too late to prevent a catastrophe will they jump in and do the bare minimum to address the issue solely so they can seem like heroes. Only it's a lot different than COVID, because there won't be a vaccine or herd immunity or a seasonal fade-out of climate catastrophe. We knew there'd be another pandemic at some point but didn't know the exact details of where/when/what, while in fact we do have a pretty good idea of the timeline for biosphere collapse but green politics is still a novelty to most people.\n\nI used to be a ""progressive"" socdem who was fooled by people like Andrew Yang into thinking that ""human-centered capitalism"" isn't an oxymoron and Bernie-style social democracy is too radical. I don't exactly know what the immediate catalyst for my anarchisming was but after I realized that left-libertarianism was a real and viable ideology, I figured out that governments (even socialist/communist states) don't want to meaningfully fix the problems they've created and that no money-driven state (hint: that means all of them) will address environmental issues in an effective and not solely performative way.

g0je5oh,i49b2n,"Yup. I'm not American or European so ""leftist"" doesn't carry the same identity weight that many of you guys seem to have had forced down your throats to put you into convenient voter categories, but it's really hard to see how there is a way forward for humanity if we continue to prioritise profits over community. I don't necessarily agree with what a lot of left political parties stand for, as their policies are generally just designed to be the opposite of whatever the right is pushing for and I don't think that's necessarily constructive or cohesive. For example, I think we can all agree that wealth/resource distribution is one of the biggest systems than need to change for the sake of our world, but the parties that push for that are also pushing for gender-equality, LGBT rights, end of racial discrimination etc. - I don't disagree with any of that, but with so many political agendas how is there ever going to be change? How are you going to convince conservatives to close the wealth gap if they ALSO need to love their gay neighbours? In SA where I'm from, how are parties going to figure out an equitable way to distribute land if it ALSO means seizing power from the Apartheid-era oppressors? How are you going to convince people to vote against social projects funded by billionaires in return for projects that are self-sufficient, but won't provide immediate gratification?\n\nI'm just not sure if the whole ""leftist agenda"" is an effective mechanism to bring about change, simply because of its lack of focus.\n\nSide note - I personally think the biggest flaw of the old communist/socialist states was that flawed humans were put in charge of the economy, and that centralized structure allowed dictators to seize power and make eff-ups. I often wonder what that same economy would look like if we put the very best of modern AI in charge of the economy (with redundant systems around the world to monitor it for tampering), used blockchain to organise the value of things so that the system is distributed, and then left humans to deal with moral issues rather than administrative ones.

g0k6zme,i49b2n,"I'd genuinely like to know how eco-capitalism could even be defended as a position? The vast majority of arguments for capitalism are based on arguing effectively that capitalism is good and 'efficient' because it produces economic growth. Once you question the value of economic growth for its own sake beyond a point - as any half-serious environmentalist must - it hardly matters whether this is even true or not. And the constant refrain of capitalists is that we must tolerate vast inequalities as the price of this growth. Again, once we realise that we must shepherd our resources more carefully it is obvious that greater equality is necessary. Markets are ""efficient"" to the extent that they respond to buying power in the economy - if that is very unevenly distributed in the first place then market efficiency means satisfying the unnecessary wants of the wealthy and ignoring the needs of those without means.   \n\n\nThe only argument I can imagine is that technological innovation will be a necessary part (though far from sufficient alone) of responding to the climate crisis. This is true, but it is dripping with capitalist ideology to suppose that therefore only free-market capitalism with all its attendant ills is up to the task. All of the major technological innovations of modern capitalism have come from heavy state investment in R&D and concealed subsidy through state procurement (often through the military budget) - transistors, touch-screen technology, the internet, GPS, etc. etc. The only role played by the 'dynamic entrepreneurial innovation' of capitalism in this process has been to privatise profits of state innovation to corporate monopolies and oligopolies and to allow start-ups to find new ways of creating bullshit jobs and services out of these technologies.   \n\n\nFor me the question is not whether political greens should be anti-capitalist but how could they not be broadly anti-capitalist?",1596721874,t1_g0ibjis,/r/Green/comments/i49b2n/anyone_else_feel_like_they_grow_more_leftist_in/g0k6zme/

g0hwkka,i49b2n,"I suppose that depends on what you mean by ""the extremes"". Typically that word refers to someone who strongly rejects the status quo, where the status quo or something close to it is regarded as the ""moderate"" option. On our current trajectory we are heading towards utter catastrophe - our oceans will rise to wipe out entire countries, our agriculture will face regular droughts as temperatures rise and our topsoil is eroded, extreme weather events are already becoming commonplace, ecosystems are collapsing like dominoes, our basic resources are being depleted to exhaustion at an ever increasing pace, the air we breath grows more poisonous by the day, etc. *These* are the inevitable consequences of the status quo. If this is not extremism, what is? There is nothing moderate or sensible about it.  \n\n\nI am unashamed to reject this status quo unequivocally. A system capable of producing these results has no legitimacy and needs a radical overhaul.

g0l347w,i49b2n,"If the quote was 'you can't have infinite growth in *resource throughput* on a finite planet' then it would be tautological. That is, you cannot deplete non-renewable resources without recycling them, deplete renewable resources faster than replacement rate, produce waste beyond the capacity of natural sinks to absorb them indefinitely, and so on. Stein's law cannot be broken: ""if something cannot go on forever, it will stop"". When someone like David Attenborough says we cannot have infinite growth they probably have in mind primarily resource throughput rather than some technical definition of economic growth.\n\nGrowth in economics is a technical term referring to the growth in (inflation-adjusted) market value of the total transactions of goods and services in an economy. Hence, it is not directly conceptually related to the idea of resource throughput. It is conceivable on paper that resource throughput could remain constant or even decline and meanwhile the economic value of services and goods could increase (say, through innovation and technological progress). That is what I mean when I say that it is a *conceptual* mistake to say 'you can't have infinite growth' as though it is *simply* a matter of definition.\n\nThe question is whether this conceptual possibility has anything to do with reality. It is *conceptually* possible that everyone could be an expert in magneto-hydrodynamics, run faster than Usain Bolt, play chess better than Magnus Carlsen and play the cello like Yo-Yo Ma -  but it is not an *actual* possibility with any relevance to the real world.\n\nOne way to approach the question is to ask what theoretical conditions must obtain in order for there to be growth that is both sustainable and eternal. This is what the work of the ""weak sustainability"" economists I mentioned attempts to do. As I noted, 'weak sustainability' is the dominant paradigm in mainstream economics. It is standard in growth-theory to model growth with a 'production function', where the level of output Y is a function of several variables. The production function Solow used was Y(K,L,R,t) - where K is capital, L is labour, R is exhaustible resources and t a variable representing ""exogenous technological progress"" over time. Solow proceeds to ask under what conditions will eternal growth in Y be possible? He concludes (on the basis of certain assumptions about the character of his production function, namely that it is of the Cobb-Douglas type) that ""resource productivity"" - the contribution to output made by a given amount of resources - must be unbounded, i.e. a given quantity of resources can go on indefinitely making a bigger and bigger contribution to output. Furthermore, capital must be more productive than resources and perfectly substitutable for resources, so that declines in resources can be compensated for by improvements in capital productivity. Stiglitz reaches similar conclusions - he concludes that there must be indefinite ""resource augmenting technological progress"" enabling 'unbounded resource productivity'. The common feature of both is that decline in resources can be compensated for by capital and technological progress.\n\nThere is a very interesting feature to note about how Stiglitz and Solow make out their case. When I read their papers I couldn't quite believe that, for all their cleverness, this is really what they were doing: they begin by asking 'under what assumptions is eternal growth possible?', from which they then proceed to defend those - prima facie implausible and bizarre - assumptions *on the basis that they are required to ensure indefinite economic growth.* This, terrifyingly, really is the best of what our mainstream economists have to say about the sustainability of economic growth. I need not explain why this is of no use whatsoever in helping us to determine whether or not those assumptions are actually realistic and, therefore, whether or not eternal economic growth is possible in reality.\n\nI mentioned Georgescu-Rogan who was one of Stiglitz and Solow's interlocuters. He defended a so-called ""strong-sustainability"" thesis as against ""weak sustainability"" (there is some stuff about this on Wikipedia which might serve as an introduction to these debates, but unfortunately they are poor quality). Georgescu-Rogan was beginning from an entirely different framework from neoclassical economics with its tidy, disaggregated production functions. So there is a sense in which he is not concerned with neo-classical growth-theory, except to expose how wrong a foundation it all rests on. To give a very abridged version of what he has to say: our sustainable energy resources are limited to the energy recieved directly or indirectly by the sun, perfect recyclability of non-renewable materials is impossible, and all of our capital and technology is dependent on this flow of energy and materials. This is sometimes called 'entropy pessimism' because it implies that anything beyond complete subsistence on renewable energy and perfectly renewable materials is unsustainable. I think, however, that it is a great deal more plausible - in fact, much of it follows by definition from basic physical facts about the real world.\n\nThe reason I now cringe at people who handwave away the idea that eternal economic growth is not possible on a finite planet is that those who defend economic growth have a heavy burden of proof. Can they find any empirical examples of economic growth *actually* being decoupled from resource throughput? Can they find significant examples of technological progress that reduces use of one kind of resource that does not also increase the use of some other resource? Hint: no, they can't. And we are going to need more than clever abstractions if economic growth is to be actually defended as compatible with sustainability.\n\nGrowthism is a religion, of sorts, and there is a natural progression for niggling doubts about the ideology of economic growth to develop into complete apostasy. What is even so good about indefinite economic growth in the first place? There was, once upon a time, a saner breed of economists who had not entirely lost sight of the fact that economics ought to be the slave of human needs and not our master. John Stuart Mill, in the 19th century, looked forward to a time when humanity could escape the hamster-wheel in which we are caged, perpetually chasing economic expansion. In the last century, John Maynard Keynes wrote a beautiful essay - 'Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren' - in which he foresaw a time when it would no longer be necessary to ""pretend to ourselves and to every one that fair is foul and foul is fair"", when ""avarice and usury and precaution"" would no longer be our gods, and when we would at last be led ""out of the tunnel of economic necessity into daylight."" Is it so ridiculous an idea that, our basic economic problems solved, we could learn the art of satiety?\n\nYet this is the religion in the name of which we are to sacrifice our rest, our happiness, and perhaps even the planet and our civilization. Any appeal to the necessity of 'economic growth' is, to my mind, stillborn.\n\nI hope this clears things up a little :)",1596735890,t1_g0kecds,/r/Green/comments/i49b2n/anyone_else_feel_like_they_grow_more_leftist_in/g0l347w/

Cutting these by 33% for the final 4 months of the cows life means the cow emits a total of 4144 kilos rather than 4427 kilos over a 21 month life. Given that cows produce roughly 2000 burgers' worth of meat, this change would cut the cow's CO2 emissions from 2.21 to 2.07 kilos of CO2 emissions. \n\nWhen we add the 2 kilos from feed, transport and processing back in, our grand total moves from 4.41 kg to 4.07 kg CO2 emissions per burger.

g3wh58j,iky2md,"I say that because it’s true. Companies love to call products “compostable” or “biodegradable” but those terms mean next to nothing. Generally those products are *industry* compostable. In other words they don’t break down naturally in the environment but require either chemicals, pressure, and/or extreme sustained heat to break down.  \n  \n>	If all of the ingredients are biodegradable then they would be?  \n  \n\nIt’s not that simple. For instance, if you’re familiar with cellophane it was one of the first commercially available plastics introduced to consumers. It gets its name from cellulose, a plant derived substance. Hemp plastics also are generally cellulose based I believe. They’d be no more prone to breaking down than cellophane.

g49smg2,inhq11,"I'm a medical professional. Personally my take is, aside from an N95, wear the most effective mask you can get. The only reason I exclude N95s is supply can't meet medical demand. By all appearances, there is no shortage of other masks, eg what are commonly known as surgical masks, or masks that meet foreign standards (like KN95). Avoiding purchasing n95s I think makes sense to preserve limited supply for medical demand, and only on that condition that medical demand isn't being met. If you have access to masks that provide better fit and filtration than your preferred cloth, I would say get it and use it. Without a doubt there are masks for sale in the US that fit that bill. Personally I have KN95s that the FDA gave an emergency use authorization to after FDA testing, purchased for about $1.50 a piece, that I wear in public. I rotate 10 masks. Are cloth masks worth anything? Absolutely, they are way better than nothing. At the same time, there are definitely masks for sale that provide better fit/filtration. On the green issue, clearly I wouldn't be subscribed to this sub if I didn't have sympathies here. People littering masks is frustrating. I see it almost daily in the hospital parking lot. In terms of disposing of them properly, I don't think the waste side of it is nearly as weighty an issue as the impact improved mask quality has, whatever that is. There's a reason so many health care providers in NYC were able to treat so many cases in that madness without contracting COVID -- good protocols and quality PPE make a difference. Plus, masks don't necessarily need to be single use. As I said, I rotate several. Research early on tested how long SARSCOV2 is stable on different surfaces (eg, paper, plastic, some metals). Long story short, IIRC not much longer than a week on paper. Health care staff have been throwing n95s in paper bags and letting them passively decontaminate for months now, though most hospitals have better systems in place now\n\nLol @ this sub",1599428602,t1_g49lmzh,/r/Green/comments/inhq11/globally_we_are_using_129000000000_face_masks_and/g49smg2/

They also have the students go to the school kitchen to bring food from the cooks (if the school had a kitchen) and serve the rest of their class, and they would rotate this duty every day so each student had a day where they were responsible for the whole class’s sustenance.

g795466,j2zu7y,"Oil is the WORST! Moving to something else is a good decision all around. Now, I don't know what you mean by ""solar"" as an option, but your two main alternatives are 1) natural gas, if available in your area, or 2) an electric-based system. Seeing as you are here in r/Green, I will assume you want to go electric as the greener option, and if you want to use solar, your best option will be to get solar panels (photovoltaic) on your roof that will power your electric system. \n\nThe main decision you're going to make in electric is whether to go with an air source or ground source (what you're referring to as geothermal) heat pump. Simply put, air source heat pumps are cheaper, but less efficient, while geothermal has high installation costs, but longer lifetimes and greater efficiency. I suggest you get a quote for both types.\n\nThe other main advantage of ground source heat pumps is that they work at the same efficiency year round (because deep underground is a fairly constant temperature), while air source heat pumps do worse the colder it is outside (because they are trying to pull heat from the cold outside air). Being in Long Island, it isn't so cold that an air-source heat pump won't work, but a geothermal will definitely work better. Either type typically comes with a backup resistor heater in the air handler which will assist on really cold days. \n\nFor air source heat pumps, definitely look at cold-climate specific heat pumps, such as Arctic heat pumps (although although long island is kind of on the edge of where any old heat pump will work). For ground source, I recently heard about Dandelion which is supposed to be revolutionizing the industry, or just making a lot of marketing hype. \n\nFinally, before you get a new hvac system, make sure you do an energy audit and improve your building envelope. Seeing as you're using oil, you probably have an old home that is leaky and poorly insulated. Not only will insulating and sealing your home save more energy, but it will allow you to buy a smaller, cheaper new system when the time comes, Win Win!.",1601525125,t3_j2zu7y,/r/Green/comments/j2zu7y/home_heating_question/g795466/
g79pr97,j2zu7y,"I believe increasingly people are choosing air source because they’re now good enough that the price difference is just too significant to make ground source preferable. But indeed a quote for both sounds worth it.  \nImproving the insulation is essential. If you improve the insulation enough you won’t need a backup system because your house will retain enough heat to compensate for any interruption to the electricity supply.  \nIf you decide to heat your house with electricity, a heat pump is the way to go, solar would be a nice extra.",1601543586,t3_j2zu7y,/r/Green/comments/j2zu7y/home_heating_question/g79pr97/

Air source heat pump may be the way to go and I think there is a $500 rebate from NYSERDA. \n\nFirst step is always, always insulation and energy efficiency measures. Always. Then everything become more efficient, cheaper, and greener. \n\nSolar thermal is good. Not sure we have rebates for that in NY (not sure why) but they use it from Germany to the Caribbean so I assume it works in all climes and is cheap. It’s mainly for water heating in those locations. Maybe do both: solar thermal for and some sort of heat pump for space heating.

g7b27id,j3a30y,"Them heat pump water heaters are the cat's meow.  Less  cost overall over 10 years than gas or instant.     Down side is moving parts and noise. \n\nHeat pumps are dandy for heat, but only work when it's above -20F or so.  When it gets real cold, and you really need it, it might not be able to handle the truth all on it's own.  Round here, folks always have something to burn along with their heat pumps.\n\nGas is cheaper than electric, and nicer to cook with, since it's instantly on and easy to see how much it's doing.  Gas doesn't care about the quality of your cookware like induction does.      The idiom isn't ""Now you're cooking with electric""     An electric stove/oven will draw about as much as a car, so keeping that gas will leave room in the panel for a car, although 200amps should be more than enough.  \n\n\nGas is less price per watt than electric, which makes sense since there's a 1/3 loss at least converting gas to electric.    Therefore, keeping some of your stuff gas isn't a particularly bad idea, considering some of your energy is coming from gas anyway.\n\nHeat pump dryers are 3x as much when they are 'merica sized, the pay back on them is real long.  There's no efficiency advantage on a new dryer vs. and old unless the new is heat pump.  Again, gas is the cheapest way to go.    A front load washer though has significant water savings over a top loader.  \n\nOff-peak power that they can shutoff when they want but billed at a lower rate is a good deal if it's available and you can stand to run things on it.

Compared to plain electric ranges gas is better, compared to induction ranges gas stove doesn't hold up. Burning the gas releases volatile chemicals into your home even with good ventilation. You also mentioned loss of efficiency converting gas to electric. Rough estimates put gas burning ranges at ~30% efficiency while induction gets a whopping ~75% when boiling water.\n\nOne area I think keeping gas for longer is the darn dryer. See a lot of negatives about electric dryers especially regarding efficiency. New heat pump dryers seem intriguing though",1601574728,t1_g7b27id,/r/Green/comments/j3a30y/green_appliances_and_electrifying_the_home/g7b62h7/

This suggests it's likely closer to 35%  \nhttps://www.energy.gov/fe/how-gas-turbine-power-plants-work\n\nSo, if you lose 70% of the gas boiling water, you're doing about the same as a 100% efficient electric.    Resistive heating elements actually convert pretty close to 100% of the electric to heat.  The only reason people heat houses, water, clothes with gas vs. electric is gas is so much cheaper per thermal unit.  \n\nThe 70% heat you lose off the stove is only a problem if you're cooling the space.  I don't have any cooling, and looking for every btu of heat I can get in the house 8 months a year, so there's that.    When gas furnace efficiencies are calculated, it's mainly about how much heat is going up the chimney.   A good one is better than 90% efficient.     Dryers lose much more than that, but there are heat exchangers  to help recover some of that.

ga2l3qv,jhrtyh,"I painted it green.  That made it greener.\n\nJoking aside, I was somewhat on the fence about whether to go light or dark.  Light would be better in the summer, but that was more about just comfort since I don't have AC.   Dark would seem like it'd suck up some solar energy in the winter, and save some gas, so that seemed like a good choice.   In the end I settled on green, since it's in-between, and I figure all the trees and grass and stuff know something about it.   It also makes my house blend into the surroundings better, so it's less obtrusive visually.  \n\nBeyond that, the biggest bang for your buck is sealing windows and doors, chalking, insulating boring stuff like that.   \n\nPeople tend to keep the heat too damn high.    Now is the time to get used to the cold, build your tolerance and brown fat.   It's a little uncomfortable for a while, but you get used to it, then it's actually warmer when you go outside.   A house loses heat at a square of the temperature, so twice as warm inside takes 4 times as much energy.     A little lower on the thermostat pays big dividends.       Try to heat only the rooms you need, only when you need them. Do you really need all the square footage you have?  Programmable thermostats can automate it so you don't forget to turn down the heat when you leave or go to bed.\n\nIt's ridiculous how much water the ""average"" person uses.   I suggest low flow toilets, and a front loader washer.\n\nA heat pump hot water heater costs less than any other kind over a decade since it uses less energy than any other kind, according to epa.gov.   They have some hot takes on appliances and stuff to get stuff greener.    Grabbing the heat out of the air pays dividends.   There's a lot of energy that goes toward heating water.   The sun can do that too.  It was like a fad in the 70's and 80's,  that still may be valid.   The sun can be used for more than just moving electrons.  It might be especially valid if you have hot water heat.  \n\nThere's a trick where you  put a window on the outside of your house, sealed tight on some black plywood, and then when it gets warm you cycle inside air through it.   The dump I go to has lots of windows for the taking.  \n\nIf you reuse something, you didn't have someone make a new thing,  you saved that thing from the landfill, and it's cheap.\n\nHeat pump heaters neat.   Again, grabbing the heat out of the air can multiply energy put into the system.  Them new fancy ones will even work to below zero.   You can run them backwards in the summer for AC too if you're living in some hell hole.\n\nOf course, LED lights all around.   Chase down and try to eliminate ""vampire"" loads, like stuff that's drawing current when it's off.   Maybe you wire up a switch that turns off everything but the furnace in your house when you leave.  \n\nDon't be vain with your grass.  Don't water it.  Don't put fertilizer, weed killer or insecticide on it.   It's just not worth it, it's only aesthetic.    If you want to tend a crop, consider growing some food instead of grass.  Dandelions are food.   \n\nMaybe the trend here is think about what you're spending the most energy on, what resources you have available, and tackle that first.    A lot of stuff can be done with just a couple dozen dollars, so start with that.  If you have more, look at what will give the most improvement.   When it's time to replace something or do something, consider ""what's the greenest outcome""   Replacing something that works just to have it work greener might not be that green, since where does the old thing go, and what did it take to make the new thing?

gaadqdl,jhrtyh,"As far as life, it's a moral  choice.\n\nWhen I was a boy, I worked in a store that sold general crap, like a Mal-Wart but lower quality.   I realized every single truck I unloaded was soon going to be loaded in the land fill.    My house, and my life is loaded with crap.  I spend thousands of dollars a year and many hours throwing crap away.  As an adult, I'm no longer unloading trucks for a store, I'm loading trucks to go to the dump.    I think about that every time I buy something.  Everything you buy is going to get thrown away.   Clean out an elderly person's house after they pass on or go to a nursing home, and this point is driven home.   \n\nIt makes me a cheapskate.    I believe that being a cheapskate is the green way to be.   Spending money on stuff means you're allocating resources to yourself.  Resources that might better be shared for the rest of the people in the world, or resources that might be causing damage to the rest of the people in the world.   \n\nLike the new gizmo, that when I'm done with it it is sent off to an African country to be stripped of precious metals and put into a toxic fill.    It pays then to have the gizmo last as long as possible, to fight the planned obsolesce of gizmos.  Don't program in the latest environment, write efficient code.     Buy quality if you have to and make it go as long as possible.  \n\nI setup my life so I can walk, bike, or bus just about anywhere.   So, having a 16 year old car is no problem if it breaks down.      This is cheaper, as the marginal gain in efficiency of having a newer car is offset by the price of the newer car.  The price of the newer car reflects the mining for the metal, and the petroleum for the plastic, so it's greener to have an older car.   \n\nAn apt. in the city center is going to be greener than a suburban house.  Less commuting.   Shared heat.  Less land footprint.   People have been using electric cars i.e. the subway to commute around NYC for a hundred years.  While living in a big city with all it's fumes and concrete might seem obnoxious and not green, it's probably the greenest way to be aside from subsistence farming which in modern times in a first world country is a radical lifestyle.   Even in a second or third world country, there's a land use cost.   People are cutting down rain forests and the like to survive, not because it's fun.  \n\nLess people is the answer.  Environmental problems are really about sustaining the human population.   Being ""green"" is really about spreading limited resources around to a burgeoning population.",1603817102,t3_jhrtyh,/r/Green/comments/jhrtyh/how_to_make_your_home_greener/gaadqdl/

The combination of these technologies should be advanced as a solution to global warming, air pollution, and energy security. Coal-CCS and **nuclear offer less benefit thus represent an opportunity cost loss""**](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2009/ee/b809990c#!divAbstract)\n\nIt is too slow for the timescale we need to decarbonize on.\n\n>[“Stabilizing the climate is urgent, nuclear power is slow,”  “It meets no technical or operational need that low-carbon competitors cannot meet better, cheaper and faster.” ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-energy-nuclearpower/nuclear-energy-too-slow-too-expensive-to-save-climate-report-idUSKBN1W909J)\n\nThe industry is showing signs of decline in non-totalitarian countries.\n\n>[""We find that an eroding actor base, shrinking opportunities in liberalized electricity markets, the break-up of existing networks, loss of legitimacy, increasing cost and time overruns, and abandoned projects are clear indications of decline. Also, increasingly fierce competition from natural gas, solar PV, wind, and energy-storage technologies speaks against nuclear in the electricity sector. We conclude that, while there might be a future for nuclear in state-controlled ‘niches’ such as Russia or China, new nuclear power plants do not seem likely to become a core element in the struggle against climate change.""](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S221462962030089X)\n\nRenewable energy is growing faster now than nuclear ever has\n\n>[""Contrary to a persistent myth based on erroneous methods, global data show that renewable electricity adds output and saves carbon faster than nuclear power does or ever has.""](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629618300598)\n\nThere is no business case for it.\n\n>[""The economic history and financial analyses carried out at DIW Berlin show that nuclear energy has always been unprofitable in the private economy and will remain so in the future. Between 1951 and 2017, none of the 674 nuclear reactors built was done so with private capital under competitive conditions. Large state subsidies were used in the cases where private capital flowed into financing the nuclear industry.... Financial investment calculations confirmed the trend: investing in a new nuclear power plant leads to average losses of around five billion euros.""](https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.670581.de/dwr-19-30-1.pdf)\n\nThe nuclear industry can't even exist without legal structures that privatize gains and socialize losses.\n\n>[ If the owners and operators of nuclear reactors had to face the full liability of a Fukushima-style nuclear accident or go head-to-head with alternatives in a truly competitive marketplace, unfettered by subsidies, no one would have built a nuclear reactor in the past, no one would build one today, and anyone who owns a reactor would exit the nuclear business as quickly as possible.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2012/03/29/exelons-nuclear-guy-no-new-nukes/#3c8acf0a3c5d)\n\nThe CEO of one of the US's largest nuclear power companies said it best:\n\n>[""I'm the nuclear guy,"" Rowe said.

ggx39hh,kjhhoa,"We're doomed anyway, so it doesn't really matter.\n\nOur mere existence is a threat to our existence.    We want to drive to the store and get food in plastic containers, but this is going to make it harder for future generations to merely exist.    We can either lament this, or accept this.  \n\nThe only way to really change this is to move back to some sort of agrarian society, and stop making more people but folks don't want to do that.   We can mitigate it some by moving to plant based food, containers, and electric transportation, but that's really only kicking the can down the road a little.  \n\nDenying climate change means we get ours, like our parents before us, and it's up to our kids to figure it out.\n\nAlso, money.   Economy has to keep growing because capitalism,  and the factory farm companies, the oil companies, etc.  have to keep making their profits so their stocks go up and we can retire on those dividends.     The folks that own the factory farms, the oil wells, etc. are the ones with the money, and therefore the ability to write the rules.    The only way the rules can favor the rule writers, is by denying that these rules aren't sustainable.  \n\nWhile it might be nice to eat nuts and berries, the way things are setup it's cheaper to eat a fast food hamburger individually wrapped in a disposable wrapper.   This has been setup for profitability.   Another piece of this profitability is for the rule writers, the society designers, the 1% can have more if they keep the price of labor low, which means that labor can't afford local nuts and berries, but can only afford individually wrapped hamburgers from halfway across the continent.    \n\nThese folks, who actually find the hamburgers tasty since they touch all the evolutionary yum points by design, resent people encouraging them to eat local nuts and berries, since nuts and berries don't trigger the pleasure centers as well.  In this resentment they resist the nuts and berries, and people who insist that we have to eat nuts and berries.   These people don red hats to show their love of hamburgers, even though their giant guts do the same.   It's easy to blame them, but maybe they aren't the ones entirely at fault, they are more the symptom than the problem.   It's not unreasonable to raise the flag of the side of winning, there's an advantage there.    Unfortunately this helps the system continue under the delusion of democracy.    \n\nIt'd be nice to say if we do x,y,z it will all be better, but it won't.   Folks that say screw it, let's not do x,y,z because it's hard and it won't work aren't particularly unreasonable.   If the future is doomed, let's live in the now.   \n\n2000+, 2000, and 1500 years ago some short sighted folks wrote some books telling everyone ""be fruitful and multiply"",  ""reap and sow"" etc.    This might have been good advice 2000 years ago when there was a tiny fraction of the number of people on this planet as there are now.   Since it did work for a while, folks keep referring back to these books as the unquestionable truth, but these books didn't account for the exponential population growth seen in the last couple hundred years.   The authors didn't know about 0, it's not hard to imagine they didn't know about exponents either.    A lot of folks would rather accept what has worked or been true for millennia rather than what has been learned in the last centuries.  \n\n\nThe best way to continue human existence as we know it is to not make more humans.  Everything else is a delaying tactic.    Contained in the scientific definition of life though is reproduction.

If we're planting trees in a place that can't sustain them and they just fall and rot in 10, 30, 50 (pick your number) years, the carbon just gets released back into the atmosphere; the only way those trees are sequestering carbon is if we bury them very deep underground.

gmvkeh7,lgu2rg,"> Moreover, the panels can not be recycled because of the precision required to create a cell. \n\nActually they can be recycled, it's just very rarely done because so few panels are currently being decommissioned. They require special machines and processes, but when those are used the materials in the panels are more than 90% recoverable - https://grist.org/energy/solar-panels-are-starting-to-die-what-will-we-do-with-the-megatons-of-toxic-trash/. This is a pending problem that already has a just-as-pending solution. Just like there was a huge claim that the world would be filled with worn out lithium batteries; but the people who actually knew about the stuff knew that the batteries would last longer than people were claiming, and that they are both re-usable (as stationary storage, they're just great as EV batteries anymore) and can be recycled. In fact Tesla plans to get much of it's future cobalt by recycling the batteries in cars they have already sold. \n\nPlus, they are usually re-usable before they need to be recycled. Even if a panel is bad, many of the cells in it may still be good and can be used in a new 2nd-life panel. It may not be as efficient as it was when it was new, and definitely not as efficient as the new panels, but it's still productive. \n\n\nMining waste from fossil fuels, especially coal, is a much, much bigger issue. \n\nOver the last year or two, there's been this idea of rejecting the ""better"" because it isn't perfect, even if it's 90% there.",1612999687,t1_gmucsnq,/r/Green/comments/lgu2rg/interestingly_even_elon_musk_believes_in_the/gmvkeh7/

gmz7knt,lgu2rg,"So when they state 95% recycled in the article it's not really based on usability. The silicon recovered is low purity and if it was used to make solar panels again it would have to go through the most energy intensive step of solar cell production (57% of total manufacturing energy cost). That percentage is from a meta data paper ""Energy Balance of the Global..."": https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es3038824\n\nIf someone's interested in basic calculations energy returns of solar: ""Energy Payback Time and CO2 Emissions of PV Systems"". Energy breaks even at about 1-3 years. For CO2 emissions, wind and hydro beat solar. Also, I assume that the chemicals/toxins from recycling/repairing turbines is less than that used for solar silicon recycling. \nWith that said, I think wind and hydro should be used for sure, but I am not sure how nuclear compares to solar with a flow, thermal, or gravity-based battery system.\n\nP.S. I noted solar papers never include transport or mining energy costs because they are negligible compared to silicon purification. E.g. only one step of converting silicon is 175 MWH/ton silicon, transport of 1 ton across U.S. 3000 miles ~.05 MWH/ton (tesla semi), purifying silver from mine less than .053 MWH/5107 g Ag (enough to build panels for 1 ton silicon).",1613074181,t1_gmvkeh7,/r/Green/comments/lgu2rg/interestingly_even_elon_musk_believes_in_the/gmz7knt/

The history of building nuclear that we know how to build today indicates a 10–15 year timeframe for the known technology. \[…\]\n\nThe thorium crowd likes to point at India and China, but China has committed to only build a couple of molten salt reactors with a 12 MW capacity that might use thorium at some future date, and India has even less ambitious plans. \[…\]\n\nAs Mark Z.

None of these has a chance to help solve the problem, which we need implemented now. They are all opportunity costs.”\n\nThere is no empirical evidence suggesting that a 2027 time frame is remotely likely, and Top 100 Climate Influencing academics think it’s wasteful and not helpful.

gp73x0g,ltughu,"> If nuclear waste was containable, there wouldn't be radioactive nuclear waste sites.\n\nUh... right, the waste sites _are where we store the waste_. You're making my argument for me: we have dedicated spots that we can deposit this waste so that it _doesn't_ bleed into the environment. The actual physical footprint of all the nuclear waste in the world can fit into the space of just a few football fields. The ""waste sites"" for literally all other forms of power generation -- yes, even WWS -- is, well, _the environment as a whole._\n\nThere are many uses for this waste, so to call it ""waste"" is a bit of a misnomer. You're correct that long storage waste containment is a concern, but I'm not sure how that is worse than pumping shit into our atmosphere or burning piles of electronics in foreign countries? Or the 60%+ coal-fired grid in China that makes most of our ""green"" technology? Given the potential for using spent fuel in different applications, such as [diamond batteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_battery), seems irresponsible in the extreme to disregard.\n\nEDIT: Here's some documentation you can read to educate yourself a bit https://sti.srs.gov/fulltext/FCRD-NFST-2013-000263_R5.pdf",1614534496,t1_gp73eps,/r/Green/comments/ltughu/the_truth_about_nuclear_power_neither_clean_nor/gp73x0g/

Go to Navajo land where there are over 500 uranium mine tailings sites and tell me the environmental cost of nuclear is negligible.\n\nIf you think we're going to solve the radioactive waste issue with diamond batteries, you're delusional. Those batteries have only a tiny number of industrial uses, meaning the demand for sequestering radioactive material in diamond, a costly process, is minimal. It's a neat trick and I hope they use it for space probes and the like, but the power output is too small for any but the most unique applications.\n\nSolar and wind have real issues -- the best way to not emit GHG for energy is to simply use less energy by designing our infrastructure more intelligently -- but saying they're comparable to nuclear in the long-term problems they pose is absurd.

Because of a decades long PR campaign and false science being put out, in the same manner, style, and using the same PR company as the tobacco industry used when claiming smoking does not cause cancer.\n\nA recent metaanalysis of papers that claimed nuclear to be cost effective were found to be illegitimately trimming costs to make it appear cheaper.\n\n> [Merck suppressed data on harmful effects of its drug Vioxx, and Guidant suppressed data on electrical flaws in one of its heart-defibrillator models. Both cases reveal how financial conflicts of interest can skew biomedical research. Such conflicts also occur in electric-utility-related research. Attempting to show that increased atomic energy can help address climate change, some industry advocates claim nuclear power is an inexpensive way to generate low-carbon electricity. Surveying 30 recent nuclear analyses, this paper shows that industry-funded studies appear to fall into conflicts of interest and to illegitimately trim cost data in several main ways. They exclude costs of full-liability insurance, underestimate interest rates and construction times by using “overnight” costs, and overestimate load factors and reactor lifetimes. If these trimmed costs are included, nuclear-generated electricity can be shown roughly 6 times more expensive than most studies claim. After answering four objections, the paper concludes that, although there may be reasons to use reactors to address climate change, economics does not appear to be one of them.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-009-9181-y)\n\nIt is the same PR technique that the tobacco industry used when fighting the fact that smoking causes cancer.\n\n> [The industry campaign worked to create a scientific controversy through a program that depended on the creation of industry–academic conflicts of interest.

Any reactor that uses uranium is bad because the half-life of the uranium-235 is too long and too toxic. You've probably heard of thorium reactors, and they are much much safer than uranium-235. Although they've had problems with being commercially viable in the past they are definitely a real way to make a nulcear reactor. They do not melt down, create U-233 waste which is not very radioactive after 200ish years (order of magnitude better than current nuclear waste) and can create a lot of carbon free energy. There are problems with it, but there are also problems with green energy. \n\nWe have to decide what waste products we want. Li-ions are horrible for the envi especially with the cobalt they use. Production of windmills and solar panels also cause some form of environmental destruction. So does Th-fission reactors. But like I said above, I do not see how we can get to 100% renewables without nuclear. We need that base level of energy in the grid for the grid to function - renewables do not allow for this. \n\n[Here](https://whatisnuclear.com/thorium.html) is a link about Th-fission if you're interested.

gvz8pff,mz4o14,"Interesting video! Misleading title.\n\nEating less meat **alone** won't save the planet. But that's not the question this video wants to debate.\n\nThe video seems to be made in opposition to the 'silver bullet' talk that the meat industry attracts. The main point they make is that food is only one part of the fight against climate change, and we shouldn't forget about the others. Can't argue with that.\n\nBut it also take a lot of liberties, mixing best-case and worst-case examples in ways that consistently flatter the meat industry.\n\nOn the plus side the video covers some really important subtleties about greenhouse gases. For example they draw a distinction between carbon atoms already in circulation and those that we release by burning fossil fuels. The latter are a much bigger problem.\n\nThey also point out the different between agriculture for human consumption and the kind of low-quality nutrients we can feed to livestock. Cows eating waste = good, eating grain = bad. So far so good.\n\nHOWEVER the video does cut quite a few corners to make an argument, to the point of being misleading.\n\nFor example they start with an argument that boils down to ""turning fully vegan would only save 2.6% of the USA's GHG emissions, and a more realistic 10% veganism rate would save just 0.26%, which is basically zero so veganism can be discarded as a helpful option"".\n\nBut that's an argument against a straw man opponent. No one says veganism alone will let us keep burning oil, they're just saying that eating less meat **helps**. Minutes later they show that food in total is responsible for just 8.6% of the USA's emissions, so by their own numbers going vegan would still slash your food-based emissions by almost 30%. Overall it feels like a bad-faith argument, and the rest of the video leaves a similar taste when it comes to its choice of examples and comparisons.\n\nAnd finally a single Google search about this academic shows a fair amount of controversy. [This article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/mar/24/un-meat-report-climate-change) does a good job of appraising him fairly.\n\nHe's not a corporate shill by any means, but when your only academic source for a video is someone whose ""job is to research ways to reduce livestock's environmental impact"" you may not be getting an entirely unbiased opinion about the value of reducing livestock's environmental impact.",1619472730,t3_mz4o14,/r/Green/comments/mz4o14/eating_less_meat_wont_save_the_planet_heres_why/gvz8pff/

gx5cplw,n5n3z9,"These powerpoint reactors will likely get one or two built and then everyone else will bail after the first few SMRs end up more expensive than traditional nuclear, which is the result of every independent assessment\n\n\nThe UK government\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/small-modular-reactors-techno-economic-assessment\n\nThe Australian government\n\nhttps://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=8297e6ba-e3d4-478e-ac62-a97d75660248&subId=669740\n\nThe peer-reviewed literature\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030142152030327X\n\n> the cost of generating electricity using SMRs is significantly higher than the corresponding costs of electricity generation using diesel, wind, solar, or some combination thereof. These results suggest that SMRs will be too expensive for these proposed first-mover markets for SMRs in Canada and that there will not be a sufficient market to justify investing in manufacturing facilities for SMRs.\n\nEven the German nuclear power industry knows they will cost more\n\n>[Nuclear Technology Germany (KernD) says SMRs are always going to be more expensive than bigger reactors due to lower power output at constant fixed costs, as safety measures and staffing requirements do not vary greatly compared to conventional reactors. ""In terms of levelised energy costs, SMRs will always be more expensive than big plants.""](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/german-nuclear-industry-cautious-about-usefulness-small-reactors-energy-transition)\n\nWhat has never been supported is NuMeme's claims that it will be cheaper.  They also have never presented how they arrived at their costs, beyond 'gas costs this much, lets pretend ours will be cheaper'.\n\nThis is why [8/36 cities who had subscribed to NuScale have backed out after the company's refusal to show how they arrived at their ballooning predicted costs](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/11/several-us-utilities-back-out-deal-build-novel-nuclear-power-plant)\n\nThese are the last throes of an industry in decline, desperately trying to retain relevance as nuclear is out competed by faster, cheaper, cleaner alternatives.\n\nThere is also the aspect that in some countries SMRs are only being promoted because it allows subsidization of military submarine reactors under civil budgets\n\n>[Only if military needs are driving this decision is it explicable, Stirling says. “Even in a worst case scenario, where this massive Rolls Royce production line and supply chain investment is badly delayed (or even a complete failure) with respect to civil reactor production, what will nonetheless have been gained is a tooled-up facility and a national skills infrastructure for producing perhaps two further generations of submarine propulsion reactors, right into the second half of the century. “And the costs of this will have been borne not by the defence budget, but by consumers and citizens.”](https://thefifthestate.com.au/energy-lead/how-the-uks-secret-defence-policy-is-driving-energy-policy-with-the-public-kept-in-the-dark/)\n\nEven if SMRs fail, which they will the moment people realize how much they cost, it will have been a success for those pushing it because they have never been about economical power, they have always been about putting submarine reactor development under civil budgets.\n\n>[Prof Andy Stirling from Sussex argues that one reason the government is willing to burden householders with the expense of nuclear energy is because it underpins the supply chain and skills base for firms such as Rolls Royce and Babcock that work on nuclear submarines. He said: “It is clear that the costs of maintaining nuclear submarine capabilities are insupportable without parallel consumer-funded civil nuclear infrastructures](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48509942)\n\n>[Rolls Royce, which makes reactors for nuclear submarines, has been pressing the government to agree a fleet of small modular reactors for power generation in the UK. This civilian technology would be transferable to submarines.](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48509942)\n\nThere are the propagandists and the useful idiots pushing SMRs; nobody in their right mind expects them to be an economical source of energy for the consumer.\n\nAs the main article above rightly points out:\n\n>So why are they doing this? Because it allows them to defer governmental climate action while giving the appearance of climate action. They can pander to their least intelligent and wise supporters by asserting that renewables aren’t fit for purpose, while also not doing anything about the real problem because SMRs don’t exist in a modern, deployable, operable form yet.\n\nSMRs, like all 'advanced nuclear' is a scam to delay climate action for a decade instead of investing in what decarbonizes faster\n\n>[“Stabilizing the climate is urgent, nuclear power is slow,”  “It meets no technical or operational need that low-carbon competitors cannot meet better, cheaper and faster.” ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-energy-nuclearpower/nuclear-energy-too-slow-too-expensive-to-save-climate-report-idUSKBN1W909J)\n\n>[""Contrary to a persistent myth based on erroneous methods, global data show that renewable electricity adds output and saves carbon faster than nuclear power does or ever has.""](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629618300598)\n\n>[""In sum, use of wind, CSP, geothermal, tidal, PV, wave, and hydro to provide electricity for BEVs and HFCVs and, by extension, electricity for the residential, industrial, and commercial sectors, will result in the most benefit among the options considered.

Coal-CCS and **nuclear offer less benefit thus represent an opportunity cost loss""**](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2009/ee/b809990c#!divAbstract)\n\nEven the nuclear industry is giving up on itself, as the CEO of Exelon said:\n\n>[""I'm the nuclear guy,"" Rowe said.

h0seva1,ntbncz,">First author, Dr Małgorzata Desmond (UCL and the Children’s Memorial Health Institute, Warsaw) explained: “We found the vegans had higher intakes of nutrients that indicated an ‘unprocessed’ type of plant -based diet, which is in turn linked to lower body fat and better cardiovascular risk profile. On the other hand, their lower intakes of protein, calcium, and vitamins B12 and D may explain their less favourable bone mineral and serum vitamin concentrations.\n\nI'm curious if this could be countered with supplements or like you said, a more varied diet. And assuming the nutritional needs are met I'm also curious if that 3cm shortage would vanish or not.\n\n>“We were initially surprised by the poor cardiovascular health profile of the vegetarian children, but their dietary data showed that they were eating a relatively processed type of plant-based diet, with less healthy levels of fibre and sugars compared to the vegans. So, we are learning that just eating plant-based diets is no guarantee of health, we still need to select healthy foods.”\n\nIt also seems like a noteworthy portion of the vegetarian group also ate more meat substitutes.

Taking a glance at the Impossible burger ingredients, it certainly doesn't look healthy. Coconut oil raises concerns for me; I know it's heavy on saturated fat, and I remember reading about blood level worries as well.\n\nI think there could be a significant improvement in dietary health seen if people prepared more of their meals themselves rather than getting them pre-made from big companies, and were educated better on what is and isn't needed/healthy.\n\nI must admit find this line very funny:\n\n> we are learning that just eating plant-based diets is no guarantee of health, we still need to select healthy foods.\n\nBecause, like, it's worded as if it's some new discovery, but it should be common sense.

Never going to fix the problem by buying more stuff.  \n\nBut visiting your website it seems a lot more like “a browser plug-in that offsets some of the carbon emissions from your purchases via affiliate links”. That’s a much more achievable aim, and I’d be more inclined to use it, like I use ecosia. Fairly casually and unconcerned about checking results.  \n\nThere’s still the issue of misplacing focus, when carbon offsetting isn’t nearly as good as reducing consumption, or checking the provenance of what you’re buying overall.

If I were to sign up to this I would expect you to work with ethical companies so that consumers using your product are directed towards these options, vegan food companies (there’s a plethora out there), ethical pet food companies (v-dog, because animals etc.)  companies aimed at long lasting products (Only buy once), environmentally focused brands (Patagonia etc).\n\nI would want a lot more transparency,\nexactly how the money is used to ‘offset emissions’? Who do you work with? Do you use Dacc or just plant trees? \nWhy you keep 60%+ profits? Are they reinvested or do you just take big bonuses? \nHow you calculate the emissions of my purchase and how you can be sure these are fully offset? And if they aren’t how I can ensure they completely are?",1623324323,t3_nwj1w2,/r/Green/comments/nwj1w2/i_need_your_help_to_build_the_most_comprehensive/h19mtwr/

Most people will continue to consume, this is the world we live in and our mission is to at least make consumerism more eco-friendly.\n\nFinally, about the donation percentage - this is just the first feature we released and we're working on a lot more that will let you as a consumer choose how you want to become eco-friendly. Also I couldn't disagree more on what you wrote about ""dont provide any value"". We donate money on your behalf to green projects and you don't have to spend additional money on your end. We already interviewed lots of users who love this and there are other companies out there that are doing similar things and donated money to incredible projects.

Annually, 1 billion toothbrushes are thrown away each year, and each takes 1000 years to decompose. In addition to the negative environmental factors caused by toothbrushes, they do not address soft and hard oral tissue care. Plastic toothbrushes pose a problem for waste, and this research relates new methods and materials that may be used for producing efficient, recyclable, and replaceable toothbrushes.  \n  \nAccording to a 2020 British Dental Journal study in London, the negative environmental impact of electric toothbrushes is 1100% greater than bamboo toothbrushes. The disparity can be attributed to greater transport costs due to weight and resources used in its production.  \n  \nOur design philosophy follows that when economic and environmental interests align, the world moves forward. As a whole, our product builds upon the efficacy of regular plastic toothbrushes with the stronger oral benefit of miswak, as well as surpasses current generation eco-friendly toothbrushes in material cost. The design makes few concessions regarding its goal of sustainability. Further concerns regarding future modifications of the toothbrush include consultations with a microbiologist on possible biohazards on the aluminum and hemp string. Manufacturing and distribution methods must also be addressed and taken into account regarding the cost, both environmentally and economically.  \n  \nSpecial Thanks to:  \n  \nMr. Valdez - South Texas ISD Science Academy  \n  \nMr. Coalson - South Texas ISD Science Academy  \n  \nDr. Brett Duane - Dental Public Health (Trinity College, Dublin)  \n  \nDr. Nancy Burkhart - Texas A&M College of Dentistry",1624335549,t3_o5e53x,/r/Green/comments/o5e53x/i_and_my_team_designed_a_zero_waste_toothbrush/h2m8lhd/

We're still using designs from the early Cold War era. They've been improved over time, and are much better than they used to be, but there's not much new in nuclear in about half a century now. Cold War adherence to the uranium cycle, because of its parallel use for strategic defence, has locked us in the past. It's way past time to break out of the past and advance these systems.\n\n3: We need to put much more research into fusion. Fission is literally WW2 technology.

We can build so many windmills or solar panels quite quickly, compared to how long it takes to go from the first shovel to the first watt for any nuclear power plant, even the simplest (though also least efficient) designs. During WW2, the US government proved that a nuclear power plant can't be built very quickly, as long as you overlook the horrific pollution that haste will create. We obviously don't want that. But the time it takes under current regulation is perhaps too long. And yet, I'm not suggesting that we relax regulation, for what I hope are obvious reasons. Perhaps there's a way to streamline them.\n\nI think we should be asking, though, why our current system of regulation does not seem to achieve what simple physics suggests **should** be the gains realized from such an enormously energy-dense source. I can't help but think that we must be doing something wrong. At the same time, I would never agree to any compromise which included a compromise of safety. But I have, many times, suggested that nuclear power should be the exclusive purview of governments only, and not any corporations or other private interests. There should be no profit motive associated with it, ever. Only a net gain for those served. And if **that** can't be achieved, either with adequate economy or adequate safety, then we just have to accept that it's not working out, and let it go for good.\n\nBUT, that should not be done at the cost of replacing it with more fossil fuels, which are objectively worse in the short term.\n\nI certainly agree with you that aggressive deployment of green energy is ideal in all cases, however.

h32chvb,o7r8s7,"A valid question so I'll give you an in-depth answer.\n\n> Aren't commercial bees really bad for the planet though? Thought they compete with the wild bees for food. \n\nBeekeeper here: No.\n\nCommercial honeybees are *required* for our food production. And commercial honeybees aren't competing for food with wild/native bees.\n\n1/3 of our food production *relies* on honeybees. No other bee species can handle our dense mono-culture type of agriculture. Bumblebees, mason bees, etc. won't cut it. They cannot fly the distances required or be in the densities we need.\n\nWild/native bees are dying off for 3 reasons mainly:\n\n* Global warming is changing the climate in some areas so fast that the wild/native bees cannot migrate to keep up. (And some species of bumblebees are in ""pockets"" of temperatures/climate and are doomed.)\n\n* Pesticides. Our heavy use of pesticides not only impact bees but all insects and insects are critical and required for life on earth. Many companies *routinely* coat seeds with systemic pesticides which makes the whole plant toxic to insects. Homeowners often buy flower seeds at corporate box stores thinking that they're helping bees but the flowers are de facto poisonous to the bees.\n\n* Changes in the bees environments by human activity. Just like monarch butterflies no longer migrate to parts of the US because we've killed off all the milkweeds that are their food source, we've killed off many of the [wild/bees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee#Population_decline) because we've wiped out the plants they depended on.\n\nHoneybees are in danger -- and again 1/3 of our food *requires* honeybees -- primarily for 3 reasons:\n\n* Imported mites. The [varroa destructor mite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_bee#Varroa_mites) was imported from Asia. Imagine having a parasite the size of a plate attached to your body sucking the life out of you -- that's what varroa mites are to honeybees. (Our solution is primarily to treat the beehive with chemicals to kill the mites, only semi-successfully.)\n\n* Pesticides, especially neo-nic ([neonicotinoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonicotinoid)) pesticides. Bees by their genetic nature and short lifespans don't have much of an immune system or ability to process poisons. Even GMO corn saturated with RoundUp is bad for bees (the bees collect the corn's pollen).\n\n* We stress honeybees in bizarre, unnatural ways. We breed them to be much larger than they normally would be. Some house them in beehives much larger than they normally would in nature. We ship bees in trucks, starting them out in early spring in the California almond groves, then move hives in trucks across the country to different states as different crops bloom and need pollinating. Some bees literally travel from California to Maine to pollinate blueberries. We can only imagine the stresses that puts on the bees.\n\nEdit: Typos, clarity.\n\n> ""We're the last real cowboys, the last people moving livestock across the United States."" -- Beekeeper Andy Card",1624673523,t1_h3230qx,/r/Green/comments/o7r8s7/epa_inaction_blamed_as_us_bees_suffer_second/h32chvb/

Because of a decades long PR campaign and false science being put out, in the same manner, style, and using the same PR company as the tobacco industry used when claiming smoking does not cause cancer.\n\nA recent metaanalysis of papers that claimed nuclear to be cost effective were found to be illegitimately trimming costs to make it appear cheaper.\n\n> [Merck suppressed data on harmful effects of its drug Vioxx, and Guidant suppressed data on electrical flaws in one of its heart-defibrillator models. Both cases reveal how financial conflicts of interest can skew biomedical research. Such conflicts also occur in electric-utility-related research. Attempting to show that increased atomic energy can help address climate change, some industry advocates claim nuclear power is an inexpensive way to generate low-carbon electricity. Surveying 30 recent nuclear analyses, this paper shows that industry-funded studies appear to fall into conflicts of interest and to illegitimately trim cost data in several main ways. They exclude costs of full-liability insurance, underestimate interest rates and construction times by using “overnight” costs, and overestimate load factors and reactor lifetimes. If these trimmed costs are included, nuclear-generated electricity can be shown roughly 6 times more expensive than most studies claim. After answering four objections, the paper concludes that, although there may be reasons to use reactors to address climate change, economics does not appear to be one of them.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-009-9181-y)\n\nIt is the same PR technique that the tobacco industry used when fighting the fact that smoking causes cancer.\n\n> [The industry campaign worked to create a scientific controversy through a program that depended on the creation of industry–academic conflicts of interest.

h4ib9hp,ogan0q,"> Among the most cost-effective steps natural gas producers can take is replacing old equipment, the EIA notes. Many pumps, valves and compressors on a gas-drilling pad emit methane in the course of their operations, and tend to emit more as they age — especially if they aren't maintained. The EIA recommends replacing many components early and replacing gas-powered parts with electrified versions, which leak less gas in their operations.\n\nThat sounds like a very good idea.  It does **not** sound like ""without spending a penny"".\n\nSomeone's going to have to pay to reduce global warming.

Yes, personal choices can make a small difference, and are a worthy endeavor, but becoming zero waste as one individual will not save us alone ( we won't even go into how everyone still makes hidden waste just by being a member of society). That also means that your parents alone are not going to kill the planet. The issue here is systemic: corporations and politicians allowed for us to reach this point, so your efforts are better spent focusing on that. Focus on voting for representatives who share your values, campaigning for issues that matter to you, etc. If you need something more concrete, go on walks and detrash while you walk. Look into careers that promote sustainability. If you can spare a few bucks, do recurring donations to an environmental charity. Reduce your meat and dairy consumption where possible, and look at what local foods you can buy in season. If you want to try to work with your parents, talk about how you can do a compost pile to make soil for the gardens, or little things like that where they see a tangible benefit (just avoid any words about sustainability). And finally, remember that you can still Refuse, Reduce, Repair, and Reuse, preferably in that order.\n\nYou don't need to do all of these things, but hopefully you feel like you can do some so that you can feel empowered despite your situation.\n\nTo answer your question about recycling alone, plastic recycling is a scam. Metal is very important because the more it's recycled, the less we need to mine for new material. Check to see if where you live you can get paid for bringing in metal scraps or aluminum, and you may be able to sneak some recycling into your household that way ("" I'm doing it for lunch money"").\n\nGood luck, stay strong.",1627013174,t3_opfiag,/r/Green/comments/opfiag/if_recycling_is_a_scam_then_what_should_i_do/h67mcud/

This way, you can find jobs that are more aligned with your environmentally conscious behaviour, and you will enjoy those jobs a lot more. Hopefully because you are so passionate you will be able to find a good job and gain promotions. Also you could start finding community groups and charities that focus on environmental sustainability. I think the key is power in numbers. You won't have any luck with your mum, but if you can find like minded people to work on projects with, or find a job that will help you grow and learn in the field, you will feel much better. I studied environmental engineering and am working on sustainability projects. I still live at home and while my family is relatively normal in terms of consumption and waste generation.

h8rl383,p3ffiq,I'm not sure if we can actually go without it. Where I live we have lots of sun and rivers. We have tons of hydro and solar plants and some wind ones too but they only produce about 40% of total power.\n\nSadly we still get around 25% from cole from 2 plants and the rest of the energy from a single small nuclear plant. It's usually the one that comes in clutch when the others can't deliver.\n\nPlus if I'm not wrong we still can't actually recycle solar plants? And hydros are so common here that they disrupted the rivers quite a bit so we probably can't even get many more.\n\nPlus we will probably develop thorium nuclear plants and those new reactors that are all the rage these days to atleast eliminate the cloal ones.,1628848290,t3_p3ffiq,/r/Green/comments/p3ffiq/more_nuclear_power_isnt_needed_so_why_do/h8rl383/
h9080wt,p3ffiq,"This is the best article I have seen on this in a while\n\n>But many experts, including Steve Holliday, the former CEO of the U.K. National Grid, say that notion[Baseload generators] is outdated. In a 2015 interview Holliday trashed the concept of baseload, arguing that in a modern, decentralized electricity system, the usefulness of large power stations had been reduced to coping with peaks in demand.\n\n>But even for that purpose, Sarah J. Darby, associate professor of the energy program at the University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute, told me, nuclear isn’t of much use. “Nuclear stations are particularly unsuited to meeting peak demand: they are so expensive to build that it makes no sense to use them only for short periods of time,” she explained. “Even if it were easy to adjust their output flexibly—which it isn’t—there doesn’t appear to be any business case for nuclear, whether large, small, ‘advanced’ or otherwise.”\n\n..\n\n>In a white paper published in June, a team of researchers at Imperial College London revealed that the quickest and cheapest way to meet Britain’s energy needs by 2035 would be to drastically ramp up the building of wind farms and energy storage, such as batteries. “If solar and/or nuclear become substantially cheaper then one should build more, but there is no reason to build more nuclear just because it is ‘firm’ or ‘baseload,’” Tim Green, co-director of Imperial’s Energy Future Lab told me. “Storage, demand-side response and international interconnection can all be used to manage the variability of wind.”\n\n..\n\n>“The U.S. and France have openly acknowledged this military rationale for new civil nuclear build,” he told me. “U.K. defense literature is also very clear on the same point. Sustaining civil nuclear power despite its high costs, helps channel taxpayer and consumer revenues into a shared infrastructure, without which support, military nuclear activities would become prohibitively expensive on their own.”\n\n..\n\n>In the U.K., bodies including the Nuclear Industry Council, a joint forum between the nuclear industry and the government, have explicitly highlighted the overlap between the need for a civil nuclear sector and the country’s submarine programs. And this week, Rolls-Royce, which builds the propulsion systems for the country’s nuclear submarines, announced it had secured some $292 million in funding to develop small modular reactors of the type touted by the Prime Minister.\n\n..\n\n>“There is no foreseeable resource constraint on renewables or smart grids that makes the case for nuclear anywhere near credible,” he added. “That the U.K. Government is finding itself able to sustain such a manifestly flawed case, with so little serious questioning, is a major problem for U.K. democracy.”",1629011557,t3_p3ffiq,/r/Green/comments/p3ffiq/more_nuclear_power_isnt_needed_so_why_do/h9080wt/

It sucks, but we need solutions that fit the world we live in, and high-tech windmills and solar panels imported from China and installed only by skilled engineers are not appealing to places with high unemployment or blue collar communities.\n\nNo reason for wealthy, well-educated counties like the EU to hold back from going 100% renewable where they can, but nuclear compromise is definitely needed in places like South Africa where we rapidly need to get off coal, and the US where green tech is seen as too socialist for half the country to approve of.",1628864428,t3_p3ffiq,/r/Green/comments/p3ffiq/more_nuclear_power_isnt_needed_so_why_do/h8sb20h/

h9najrb,p7w8c8,"> Instead, they would run on electric propulsion, with power generated from hydrocarbons using a solid oxide fuel cell, or SOFC. Typically run in a zero-emissions fashion using hydrogen as fuel, SOFCs are also capable of generating electricity from hydrocarbon fuels, with high efficiency, low cost, and simple machinery. The by-products are water and carbon dioxide, making it simple to capture and store both separately.\n\n> The solid oxide fuel cell is critical,"" says research team member Travis Schmauss, ""because it burns the fuel with pure oxygen, yielding a concentrated CO2 product that is storable. If we just burned the fuel with air, it would be heavily diluted with nitrogen, yielding too much gas to store. When the concentrated CO2 is compressed, it can be stored in a volume not much larger than that needed for the fuel, which saves space.”\n\n> The Northwestern plan calls for the ship's fuel tank to be fitted with a movable partition, such that as the fuel is spent, the fuel side of the tank can shrink, and the CO2 can be compressed using standard compressors and used to fill the tank from the other side. Compression, the team reasons, would sap about 2 percent of the energy generated from the SOFC.  \n\n> Other SOFC researchers would appear not to agree with Barnett's perceived lack of hurdles. In a 2020 study published in the journal Materials for Renewable and Sustainable Energy, researchers Nai Shi at al state that, ""when fueled with hydrocarbons, SOFCs encountered great difficulty in both performance and stability, which should be attributed to the sluggish hydrocarbon oxidizing reactions, the severe carbon deposition reactions, and the possible sulfur poisoning reactions in the anode.""  \n\nEh.

The proximate cause of the disaster was the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. It was the most severe nuclear accident since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.

It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history both in terms of cost and casualties, and is one of only two nuclear energy accidents rated at seven—the maximum severity—on the International Nuclear Event Scale, the other being the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan.\n \n**[Three Mile Island accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident)** \n \n >The Three Mile Island accident was a partial meltdown of reactor number 2 of Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station (TMI-2) in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, near Harrisburg, and subsequent radiation leak that occurred on March 28, 1979.

Joining people who also care about making a difference “empowers the people themselves, and it greatly amplifies their individual power,” Leiserowitz says. “Your power as a member of an organization working within your own local community—demanding that your local officials change, or your local school board improves climate-change education, or there’s so many other things that can be done. It’s so much more powerful than an individual writing a letter to a policymaker.”\n\nDesign-choices ripple onward.

Cheap, low input, highly successful in nutrient removal, and easy to implement.

hi146ey,qfcb6u,"So much misinformation in one comment it’s scary. \n\n> Power plants in Europe are rotting for decades. \n\nYou mean nuclear power plants? They actually are planned with a lifetime between 60-80 years in average. They’re being used and adapted to modern grid so no, they’re not left to rot for decades. France sells its extra electricity to: England, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland. \n\n> It's in the interest of profit to minimize the reported severity of incidents and keep maintenance as minimal as possible. \n\nWell i don’t know about US nuclear plants operators but the safety regulation of nuclear energy in the US is definitely the strictest one in the world so regular maintenance is definitely important for them.\n\n> You also can't trust humans to not make mistakes. \n\nThat’s true and that’s why all nuclear plants have safety systems that will make reactors shutdown automatically without human intervention in multiple risk scenarios that is convention in nuclear safety regulation worldwide. There is way stricter regulation in nuclear energy than any other sector in the world. \n\nThis is why there has only been 3 major incidents in nuclear energy’s history since 1945. All those were indeed human errors and safety regulation are always improved and made stricter every year. \n\n> In France it works somewhat because the military is heavily involved and they already have nuclear weapons.\n\nThe military in France isn’t paying or supporting any of the nuclear energy sector. France does have the nuclear “dissuasion” weapon but it’s military doesn’t control or operate or is involved in the civilian operations of its nuclear plants. \n\nFrance’s nuclear energy is controlled by Électricité de France which controls the 56 power reactors. EDF is owned by 85% by the French government. Nuclear energy produces around 70% of the country’s electricity and overall [France only emits 22grams of CO2/kWH](https://app.electricitymap.org/zone/FR) which is one of the lowest per capita in the world. \n\nOrano (ex-Areva) is the French company in charged of recycling nuclear produced waste. It does it for France nuclear reactors as well as imports the waste from other countries, recycle it and returns it to the original country. Its recycling process can remove 97% of the original volume of waste and creates a new fuel from it called MOX which can be reused to produce more electricity from some of the existing French nuclear reactors. Around 18% of France electricity is produced from nuclear waste that has been recycled into MOX. \n\n> Nuclear fuel is not infinite. \n\nThat’s true at the moment, but reserves of uranium are large enough we can use nuclear fission for many centuries worldwide. Once we manage to tackle nuclear fusion we won’t need to extract as much uranium at all. The first nuclear fusion using superconducting magnets will be finished in 2025 and ITER will be in 2035. \n\n> Was this purely political?\n\nAlmost every single blockers around the development of nuclear energy projects are political. Science has solved all our problems around safety and waste management, but politicians block their implementation or delete the work from previous administrations. \n\n> Nuclear power also comes with global policing. It's in the interest of some countries not to give some other countries capabilities to enrich uranium.\n\nThat’s true, some countries even assassinated nuclear scientists in the 70s to block some countries to develop a nuclear energy program. So there will always be geopolitical reasons why some countries can’t access nuclear energy. \n\n> Renewables give the opportunity to decentralize energy supply. Depending on where you live even becoming self sufficient. \n\nRenewables are also heavily reliant on something called the weather. It can be sufficient for short periods but many energetic strategy examples like Germany’s has shown that you can’t fully rely on them to produce all your electricity needs. \n\n> Nuclear power is their last straw for making big bucks where they don't have to compete with tens of millions of providers. It's basically a monopoly.\n\nThere are now tons of renewables investments done in France as well as an example. Offshore wind farms, solar farms. A lot of them are also heavily subsidised by the French government. You’re talking about an economical monopoly but the reality is that nuclear can produce a lot more electricity so it’s just convenient. A lot more investments in renewables will come by as well, France electric demands will increase with EVs increasing investments. \n\n> There is no recycling going currently except in one plant.\n\nI’m sure any nuclear plant operator in Europe can contact [Orano and get their nuclear waste issues sorted out](https://youtube.com/watch?v=V0UJSlKIy8g). The facility in La Hague (France) is already working with several European nuclear recycling programs. \n\n> stop conveniently picking arguments from posts that suit your point of view but consider everything that was written. \n\nIt’s funny you say so.",1635194302,t1_hhz9yxe,/r/Green/comments/qfcb6u/how_come_nuclear_energy_is_so_controversial_if/hi146ey/

It's easy to find all the ""isolated cases"".\n\n>There is way stricter regulation in nuclear energy than any other sector in the world.\n\nYou can have as much faith as you want in those companies. It is fact that as long as cost is an issue it will be the bottom line. And no one is infallible, still.\n\n>The military in France isn’t paying or supporting any of the nuclear energy sector.\n\nMy understanding is that the military is forcing continued civil nuclear energy so the nuclear weapon program can continue existing. The military doesn't pay for it. The state does. The state also owns 84.5% of EDF. (The state also pays for the military... duh.) France therefore doesn't have the option to not build new nuclear facilities. I am not claiming to be an expert though and have only read some articles about the topic.\n\n>It does it for France nuclear reactors as well as imports the waste from other countries\n\nIt is (in Europe) the last facility left. All the others in Europe have been shut down for various reasons. Sellafield alone had a ridiculous amount of incidents. Somehow La Hague has a significant amount less. I guess they are doing something right.\n\n>That’s true at the moment, but reserves of uranium are large enough we \ncan use nuclear fission for many centuries worldwide. \n\nThe math behind peak uranium is difficult topic. Rather than further argue about things I don't fully grasp I would rather link to this site, as someone has literally done the homework for me. \n\nhttp://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/bedford1/\n\n>Once we manage to tackle nuclear fusion we won’t need to extract as much uranium at all. \n\nI don't see how that has anything to do with nuclear power reactors. It rather strengthens the case that there should be no more new ""traditional"" nuclear reactors built. We have been promised fusion for so long now that I would rather expect more setbacks than success. I hope I am wrong though. Has the tritium depletion issue been solved?\n\n>Renewables are also heavily reliant on something called the weather.\n\nSome renewables are reliant on the ""weather"", yes. It's also dependent on location. Around the equator that is basically a non-issue. Solar gets worse further north and south you go anyway.\n\nWind energy is on average always available. It needs grid balancing. Industry will have to invest in power storage and structure itself in a way that it uses energy when it's available.\n\nSteel on the other hand will use hydrogen (which is ""easy"" to store) in the future (when the financial pressure is finally great enough to get them moving away from coal).\n\nFor personal energy use there will soon come a time when electric cars will be able to provide storage. Old lithium batteries will become cheap storage. They lose energy density but work for a long time after becoming useless in cars. The calculation is also different as the major energy demand (heating, cooling) is mostly time independent. A house can be viewed as giant thermodynamic energy buffer. Humans can be comfortable in a range of temperature, also dependent on whether they are asleep or not.

hi85t8d,qg67i4,"You need an education:\n\n"" unlike what happens in solar fusion—which uses ordinary hydrogen—Earth-bound fusion reactors that burn neutron-rich isotopes have byproducts that are anything but harmless: Energetic neutron streams comprise 80 percent of the fusion energy output of deuterium-tritium reactions and 35 percent of deuterium-deuterium reactions.\n\nNow, an energy source consisting of 80 percent energetic neutron streams may be the perfect neutron source, but it’s truly bizarre that it would ever be hailed as the ideal electrical energy source. In fact, these neutron streams lead directly to four regrettable problems with nuclear energy: radiation damage to structures; radioactive waste; the need for biological shielding; and the potential for the production of weapons-grade plutonium 239—thus adding to the threat of nuclear weapons proliferation, not lessening it, as fusion proponents would have it.\n\nIn addition, if fusion reactors are indeed feasible—as assumed here—they would share some of the other serious problems that plague fission reactors, including tritium release, daunting coolant demands, and high operating costs. There will also be additional drawbacks that are unique to fusion devices: the use of a fuel (tritium) that is not found in nature and must be replenished by the reactor itself; and unavoidable on-site power drains that drastically reduce the electric power available for sale.All of these problems are endemic to any type of magnetic confinement fusion or inertial confinement fusion reactor that is fueled with deuterium-tritium or deuterium alone. (As the name suggests, in magnetic confinement fusion, magnetic and electrical fields are used to control the hot fusion fuel—a material that takes an unwieldy and difficult-to-handle form, known as a plasma. In inertial confinement, laser beams or ion beams are used to squeeze and heat the plasma.) The most well-known example of magnetic confinement fusion is the doughnut-shaped tokamak under construction at the ITER site; inertial confinement fusion is exemplified by the laser-induced microexplosions taking place at the US-based National Ignition Facility.\n\nTritium fuel cannot be fully replenished. The deuterium-tritium reaction is favored by fusion developers because its reactivity is 20 times higher than a deuterium-deuterium fueled reaction, and the former reaction is strongest at one-third the temperature required for deuterium-only fusion. In fact, an approximately equal mixture of deuterium and tritium may be the only feasible fusion fuel for the foreseeable future. While deuterium is readily available in ordinary water, tritium scarcely exists in nature, because this isotope is radioactive with a half-life of only 12.3 years. The main source of tritium is fission nuclear reactors.\n\n[https://thebulletin.org/2017/04/fusion-reactors-not-what-theyre-cracked-up-to-be/](https://thebulletin.org/2017/04/fusion-reactors-not-what-theyre-cracked-up-to-be/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNeither fusion or fission nuclear reactors are renewable energy!",1635325937,t1_hi851bl,/r/Green/comments/qg67i4/86_million_government_investment_into_uk_fusion/hi85t8d/
hi87q5g,qg67i4,That’s hilarious. Nuclear fusion is one of the most environmentally friendly sources of energy. Fusion does not create any long-lived radioactive nuclear waste. The only product of a fusion reactor would be helium. The reactor would produce and consume tritium in a closed circuit. The half-life of tritium is very short and it is only used in small amounts so there is no serious danger.\n\nI’m also an undergrad physics major so I got the education part sorted thank you very much,1635327605,t1_hi85t8d,/r/Green/comments/qg67i4/86_million_government_investment_into_uk_fusion/hi87q5g/

Ecologism, Sustainability (my personal brand), Conservationism, the German Green Party, the US Green Party, etc.  It's not a party, it's a symbol and you can attribute anything you like to it.  You have chosen to attribute elitism, and that's your right.\n\n>All the Greens, in almost all countries, are the same.\n\nDemonstrably false.  They speak completely different languages and have different cultures.  You say ""almost all countries"".  Which ones are you excluding and how are they different?\n\n>Looking into political graphs, they are consistently speaking for the interests of the urban, the rich, the elite .\n\n*Citation needed.\n\n>These people man, they do not care about the environment.\n\nPeople only care about themselves and their families.  This is the same for all parties.  In the case of ""Greens like me"" I care about this generation's legacy and what my children and grandchildren think of me.  When I'm long gone, I don't want our generation to be thought of as ""the ones that destroyed the world's resources"".  Selfish?  If you like.\n \n>Greens is NOT a movement of outdoorsmen.\n\nNot exclusively, no.  I spend most of my time indoors writing code.  Why does that matter?\n\n>Green agenda basically comes down to this: population control. All of their policies aim to reduce human populations, reduce consumption, reduce emissions, and generally reduce human impact on the planet. I am not saying that reduced population is bad, but the way Greens plan their agenda, it seems that what they are after is the extermination of poor people.\n\nI would like to see solar projects throughout poorer regions so that they can desalinate water, irrigate the desert and INCREASE their wealth and populations.  In this way, CO2 can be re-absorbed into re-forestation programs and everyone benefits.  This will take MORE people to do.  Exterminate the desert and we all suffer.\n  \n>They have no pragmatic plan for balancing the cost of reducing emissions.\n\nOK, here's my plan for balancing the cost.  Stop spending money on war and instead spend it on reforestation, solar and wind technology research, free solar panels for all (globally) and pay for it with taxation on the increased global wealth, starting with the tax avoiding global giant companies.\n\n>They will not care if people freeze to death.\n\nHyperbole, much?  What if I were to accuse you of not caring if people burn to death?  Not nice is it?\n\n>They are also anti-nuclear, which is a CATASTROPHIC stance for economic and environmental reasons.\n\nTo deploy a new nuclear plant, there is a 30 year lead time and on past record it will come online $100Bns over budget.  Why not spend all that money on free solar panels for all, massive solar farms in desert regions and cabling infrastructure to pipe it to where it's needed most.  Like this: https://xlinks.co/morocco-uk-power-project/\n\n>Its calculated that in Germany thousands of people will die to pollution thanks to the burning of fossils to counter the shutdown of nuclear plants...\n  \nYeah, Germany were particularly dumb here (they already had carbon-neutral generation), but it's done now and is a short-term problem as solar and wind come online.\n  \n>These are the people that cannot see beyond their own fingers....\n\nMore hyperbole. \n  \n>Their plans to ban cars is a direct insult to all people who live in rural areas.\n  \nIf you mean ban Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) cars, EVs are going to be cheaper and have longer range than ICEs in 3 years, way before the bans kick in.  In 7 years, only the ultra-rich will be able to afford to run an ICE as petrol and maintenance costs compare TERRIBLY with all that free solar power and near-zero maintenance that an EV brings.\n  \n>They basically are the party of urbanists who have no direct contact with the environment, blind allegiance to establishment media, and hatred of poor people who cannot afford their grandiose plans.\n\nThe ""poor"" will be very poor indeed once harvests start to fail.\n\n>The Greens are the caricature of the out of touch urban elite.\n  \nAnyone who doesn't vote Green is voting for their own demise, whether rural or urban.  Vote green and you get free power and transport, food sustainability, healthier children and grandchildren and your taxes won't go to fund overseas war for the frankly rubbish prize of some shitty oil.\n  \n>TLDR: If you are poor, working class, live in rural area , and vote Greens , you should have your head checked.\n\nTLDR: If you care for your children and grandchildren, act and vote accordingly, (and label that Green if you like).",1637708657,t3_r0ox9n,/r/Green/comments/r0ox9n/the_greens_is_the_party_of_the_elitist_interests/hltw868/

hmx5ufu,r6kvsx,"I didn’t read all of that.  \n\nThe suburbanisation and ruralisation of the USA, which was enabled by things like the interstate network and a matter of policy when there was concern over nuclear strikes wiping out entire populations during the Cold War, is what has left you with many of the problems you face today.  \n\nRural living is less environmentally efficient than urban living. There are increased energy usages and transport costs are blown up. Land usage is higher. It also takes more land and damages more land, causing damage to and interrupting natural habitat.  \n\nThe fact is there is no such thing as overcrowding until far far higher density estimates. When you start getting issues like the cage houses of Hong Kong. Before that though there is no such thing as overcrowding, just insufficient infrastructure for population density.  \n\nA load of countries in the world have a higher population density than the USA, and a load of cities have higher population densities than many of yours. New York is very densely populated, but that density is supported and enabled by the most extensive metro system on the planet, so it is not a problem. Tokyo’s system improves upon even that, because they handle the cars better, and have even more infrastructure.   \n\nPeople like living in cities, and it’s hugely useful to them to do so. It is also better for the planet. What we need to ensure is that the infrastructure is there to support them, there are sufficient green spaces within cities, and access to rural and wild areas outside of cities is good and available to all.",1638445356,t3_r6kvsx,/r/Green/comments/r6kvsx/the_urbangreen_paradox/hmx5ufu/

hpgmp5j,rhrndf,"I have researched it.  It's a bit of tricky one.\n\nYou want to get the best and cheapest solar panels possible which is hard.\n\nThen you need to research how where you're going to put them.  If they are on the roof, our roofs get covered in snow frequently.  There is an ideal angle to put them at for clearing snow.  Stuff like that.\n\nThen you need to look into all the extra electronics.  You need to convert the DC into AC.  Then look into charging batteries potentially, and how you tie it all into your home.\n\nThen add up all of the stuff you need, installation costs, and then divide it by the cost of your electricity.  Then you'll see how long it will take to break even.  When I did this years ago, I think I calculated 8 years to break even.
