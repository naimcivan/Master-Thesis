fd7cptm,ek8r2m,"When the Greenland ice sheet went into a record meltdown in the summer of 2019, it raised a very terrifying specter of the future. Here was a 12.5-billion-ton mass of ice—one that’s been melting at a quickening pace since the 1980s—melting in a way scientists didn’t expect to happen for decades.\n\nWhile the ice sheet won’t completely disappear for centuries, any further increase in its melt will put coastal communities at risk of inundation. There’s an argument to be made that we should do everything possible to save the ice, and a new study explores a very controversial idea to that end: cooling the planet.\n\nThe findings, published last month in Earth’s Future, explore what would happen if the world pumped particles high into the atmosphere that would reflect sunlight back into space. This high-altitude air conditioning scheme, known as solar radiation management or SRM, would bring down the global average temperature. The paper’s results show that cooling would help slow—though not stop—the melting of the ice sheet. That could buy coastal regions time but also change the climate in other ways that may end up hurting other regions around the world.\n\nThe threats to Greenland ice are coming from seemingly all directions. Relatively hot water has undercut the glaciers tumbling down from the ice sheet, while rising air temperatures have melted it from above. Recent wildfires have also left a cake of dark soot that absorbs more sunlight, enhancing surface melt. And then there are surface pools of water that funnel into cracks in the ice, further destabilizing it. In short, climate change is engaged in an all-out war on the ice sheet that will only intensify in the coming century. Projections indicate the ice sheet melting could lead to anywhere from 10 to 20 centimeters (4 to 8 inches) of sea level rise this century, with much higher rates of rise in the Pacific.\n\nTo understand the impact geoengineering could have on Greenland, scientists ran models that simulate the climate throughout the century under a few different scenarios. In some scenarios, greenhouse gas pollution increased throughout the century or peaked by mid-century. They then took those same scenarios and added in a splash of geoengineering. The models they ran basically shot particles into the stratosphere around the equator that then dispersed around the globe. The impacts are based in part on what happens after volcanic eruptions, and the study used the equivalent a quarter of a Pinatubo eruption every year.\n\nThe results show that the planet-cooling properties of the particles would extend to Greenland, lowering air temperatures there by about 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to the scenarios without geoengineering. Runoff from melt would drop anywhere from 20 to 32 percent, with the biggest difference coming under the high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. All that means sea level rise would slow.\n\nDoug MacMartin, a Cornell scientist who has studied geoengineering, told Earther the study’s findings were in line with you’d expect from solar radiation management but that the findings used older models. Future work updated with new models could go a long way to building on the findings, and the study itself notes that some key aspects of atmospheric circulation are simplified.\n\nBut it’s not all puppies and unicorns. Geoengineering alone wouldn’t be able to stop ice from melting. It could also wreak havoc with weather in other parts of the globe, potentially pitting nations against each other. And then there’s the most concerning aspect of geoengineering, which is that once we start in on cooling the planet, stopping it could risk sudden, catastrophic climate change. So any plan to do this requires a long, hard think and making sure everyone has a say, not just rich countries with tons of coastal real estate.\n\n“Could geoengineering affect the Arctic? How effective would it be at offsetting projected polar changes due to climate change? Would there be any side effects or unintended consequences?” Ben Kravitz, a geoengineering researcher at Indiana University, told Earther in an email. “Answering these questions is critical, and this study is a welcome step in addressing such questions.”\n\nIndeed, as the world continues to put off the best climate change solution (which would be cutting emissions), it moves closer to considering more risky ways to address the changes set in motion by decades of unbridled fossil fuel use. That makes exploring these ideas in the scientific literature terrifying and important all at once.\n\n“We don’t know enough about [solar radiation management] today, but we don’t want to be in a position of making hasty choices some point in the future—which is exactly why studies like this one are so important,” MacMartin told Earther in an email.\n\nEqually important, and something that MacMartin emphasized as well, is actually doing the hard work of cutting carbon emissions. As the results make clear, blocking out sunlight is nowhere near enough to protect the coasts.",1578202447,t3_ek8r2m,/r/Green/comments/ek8r2m/geoengineering_isnt_enough_to_stop_greenland_from/fd7cptm/

fd0uff9,ejtpsc,"WASHINGTON — Federal agencies would no longer have to take climate change into account when they assess the environmental impacts of highways, pipelines and other major infrastructure projects, according to a Trump administration plan that would weaken the nation’s benchmark environmental law.\n\nThe proposed changes to the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Act could sharply reduce obstacles to the Keystone XL oil pipeline and other fossil fuel projects that have been stymied when courts ruled that the Trump administration did not properly consider climate change when analyzing the environmental effects of the projects.\n\nAccording to one government official who has seen the proposed regulation but was not authorized to speak about it publicly, the administration will also narrow the range of projects that require environmental review. That could make it likely that more projects will sail through the approval process without having to disclose plans to do things like discharge waste, cut trees or increase air pollution.\n\nThe new rule would no longer require agencies to consider the “cumulative” consequences of new infrastructure. In recent years courts have interpreted that requirement as a mandate to study the effects of allowing more planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. It also has meant understanding the impacts of rising sea levels and other results of climate change on a given project.\n\nThe act requires the federal government to prepare detailed analyses of projects that could have significant environmental effects, including long-term impacts that courts have said include climate change. Since 1970, when the law was enacted, it has undergone only one major change. That was in 1983, when the White House Council on Environmental Quality limited the use of worst-case scenarios in project reviews.\n\nBut the Trump administration has been aggressive in its efforts to roll back environmental regulations. The 50 or so pages of revisions that the Council on Environmental Quality is expected to make public on Wednesday would not amend the act itself. Rather, they would revise the rules that guide the implementation of the law.\n\n\nOnce the proposed rules are filed in the federal register, the public will have 60 days to comment on them, the official said. A final regulation is expected before the presidential election in November.\n\nDan Schneider, spokesman for the Council on Environmental Quality, said in a statement that the environmental law was overdue for an update. “The Trump administration is focused on improving the environmental review and permitting process while ensuring a safe, healthy, and productive environment for all Americans,” he said.\n\n\nPresident Trump’s latest effort to eliminate regulations on industry appears also to be a play to win over construction trade unions that have long complained that the National Environmental Policy Act has tied up energy and transit projects that create jobs.\n\n“The environmental review process designed to improve decision-making has become increasingly complex and difficult to navigate,” Mr. Trump said in a presidential message on New Year’s Day to mark the 50th anniversary of the act.\n\nHe criticized the “significant uncertainty and delays that can increase costs, derail important projects, and threaten jobs for American workers and labor union members” and said revisions would “benefit our economy and environment.”\n\nEnvironmental activists and legal experts said the proposed changes would weaken critical safeguards for air, water and wildlife. The move, if it survives the expected court challenges, also could eliminate a powerful tool that climate change activists have used to stop or slow Mr. Trump’s encouragement of coal and oil development as part of its “energy dominance” policy.\n\nIn March, a federal judge found that the Obama administration did not adequately take into account the climate change impact of leasing public land for oil gas drilling in Wyoming, a ruling that also presented a threat to Mr. Trump’s plans for fossil fuel development.\n\nOne month later, another federal judge dealt a blow to Mr. Trump’s plan to lift an Obama-era moratorium on coal mining on public lands when he found the administration did not adequately study the environmental effects of mining as required by law.\n\nAnd in 2018, a federal court cited the environmental policy act when it halted construction on the Keystone pipeline, a project President Trump has been determined to see become a reality. The court said the Trump administration had failed to justify reversing the Obama administration’s ruling that the pipeline would unduly worsen climate change. The case is still under litigation.\n\nThe Trump administration “simply discarded prior factual findings related to climate change to support its course reversal,” Judge Brian Morris of the United States District Court for Montana wrote at the time.\n\nMichael Gerrard, director of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said eliminating the need to consider climate change would lead to more pipelines and other projects that worsen global emissions. It could also put roads, bridges and other infrastructure at greater risk, he said, because developers would not be required, for instance, to analyze whether sea-level rise threatened to eventually submerge a project.\n\n“It has the potential to distort infrastructure planning by making it easier to ignore predictable futures that could severely degrade the projects,” Mr. Gerrard said.\n\nWith the proposed changes, said Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity, “You’re assuming away massive amounts of harm and you’re not even going to discuss it.”\n\nBut Michael Bridges, president of the Longview-Kelso Building and Construction Trades Council in Washington State, said he was eager to see the law revised. He said groups opposed to fossil fuels were using the environmental policy act to tie up a major coal export terminal in the state.\n\n“We had everything from singing grandmas to people dressed up as endangered species coming in,” Mr. Bridges said of public hearings on the terminal.\n\n\n\nA state analysis concluded that the terminal would allow 22 million more tons of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere over its projected 20-year life span. Mr. Bridges said he wanted strong environmental laws, but ones that take the local economy into consideration. The coal terminal, he noted, would replace an old aluminum smelter that shuttered in 2001, eliminating about 1,500 jobs.\n\n“That was a big hit for us,” he said. “I’m living in these communities, I’m building these projects, and we want them to be safe. The reason this is effective for environmental groups is that they’re able to keep timing it out until the businesses run out of money to fight it or it doesn’t make sense anymore.”\n\nWhile Mr. Trump may not be known for deep involvement in policy matters, one administration official said the president, as a former real estate developer, was familiar with the National Environmental Policy Act and has expressed keen interest in the law’s revisions. In one of his earliest environmental announcements, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to speed permitting for infrastructure, complaining that building a highway can take up to 17 years because of what he called burdensome regulations.\n\nMr. Gerrard said the environmental review requirements of New York’s state-level version of the environmental policy act had helped to defeat a golf course that Mr. Trump hoped to build in Mount Kisco, N.Y. The Seven Springs golf course would have abutted Byram Lake, a reservoir for drinking water. Mr. Gerrard, who represented opponents of the project, said environmental reviews enabled the community to show that the drinking water supply could have been endangered. Mr. Trump shelved the project in 2004, but his public comments indicate the episode still rankles.\n\nIn a speech to the National Association of Realtors in May, Mr. Trump told an appreciative crowd: “I was building a development. I was going to build some really luxury, beautiful houses.” But, he said: “I found out that I can’t build on the land.

fcvrcvq,ej6gla,"SEATTLE — Amazon has warned at least two employees who publicly criticized the company’s environmental policies that they could be fired for future violations of its communications policy.\n\nA lawyer in the e-commerce giant’s employee-relations group sent a letter to two workers quoted in an October Washington Post report, accusing them of violating the company’s external communications policy. An email sent to Maren Costa, a principal user-experience designer at the company, and reviewed by The Post warned that future infractions could “result in formal corrective action, up to and including termination of your employment with Amazon.”\n\nThe lawyer in the human resources group, Eric Sjoding, advised Costa in the Nov. 22 email to “review the policy again and in the future anytime you may consider speaking about Amazon’s business in a public forum.”\n\nCosta and Jamie Kowalski, an Amazon software development engineer, told The Post in a joint statement in October that the company is contributing to climate change as its cloud computing business aids oil- and gas-company exploration. Costa also met with Amazon’s human resources department to discuss the matter in October.\n\n“It was scary to be called into a meeting like that, and then to be given a follow-up email saying that if I continued to speak up, I could be fired,” Costa said via email, referring to Amazon’s warnings to her. “But I spoke up because I’m terrified by the harm the climate crisis is already causing, and I fear for my children’s future.”\n\n“It’s our moral responsibility to speak up — regardless of Amazon’s attempt to censor us — especially when climate poses such an unprecedented threat to humanity,” Costa wrote.\n\nKowalski acknowledged receiving a similar letter from Sjoding but declined to comment on it. A third worker, Emily Cunningham, said that she was informed in a separate meeting that she had violated the company’s policies after speaking out on social media and to news organizations about Amazon’s climate impact.\n\nAmazon’s external communications policy “is not new and we believe is similar to other large companies,” company spokeswoman Jaci Anderson said in a statement. In response to whether Amazon was trying to stifle workers, Anderson said employees are “encouraged to work within their teams,” including by “suggesting improvements to how we operate through those internal channels.”\n\nTech workers have recently become more outspoken about concerns over their employers’ policies. During a Sept. 20 protest, thousands of Amazon employees walked out and criticized the company’s climate policies and practices. In November 2018, thousands of Google employees walked off the job to protest of the company’s handling of sexual harassment claims. Workers at Google, Amazon and Microsoft have spoken out in criticism of facial-recognition technology from their companies, fearing misuse by law enforcement and other government agencies.\n\nAs a result, some of those companies are attempting to crack down. Some Google employees have alleged they were recently fired in retaliation for their public criticism of the company’s policies and their attempts to organize. Google said the firings were a result of violations of its policies around accessing and sharing internal documents and calendars and has denied they were retaliatory.\n\nOn Sept. 5, a day after an employee climate group emailed colleagues about the Sept. 20 walkout, Amazon updated its communications policy to create “a more streamlined and user-friendly way to request PR approval to participate in external activities,” according to a notification on the company’s internal website viewed by The Post. The policy requires a “business justification” for any communications and notes that approval could take up to two weeks.\n\nThe earlier version of the policy, which had not been routinely enforced with activist employees, required workers to request approval via email from senior vice presidents to comment publicly. The update requires permission from lower-level executives and can be sought via an intranet page, a change Amazon’s Anderson said makes its easier for employees to give speeches and grant media interviews.\n\n“As with any company policy, employees may receive a notification from our HR team if we learn of an instance where a policy is not being followed,” Anderson said.\n\nThe day before the walkout, Bezos held a news conference agreeing to measure and report Amazon’s emissions on a regular basis and meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement 10 years early. Critics said at the time that the commitments lack accountability and transparency.\n\nThree weeks after, Amazon released a new policy statement outlining its positions on a variety of hot-button issues for which it has faced criticism, including an acknowledgment that it would continue to work with the energy industry.\n\n“While our positions are carefully considered and deeply held, there is much room for healthy debate and differing opinions,” the company wrote at the time.\n\nAll three employees are members of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, a group that has called on the company to commit to being carbon neutral by 2030, to end cloud computing contracts that help energy companies accelerate oil and gas extraction, and to stop funding politicians and lobbyists who deny climate change.\n\nAmazon also has a social media policy that allows workers to post missives as long as they do not disclose confidential business information. Workers also are supposed to note that they are expressing their own opinions, not the company’s. Anderson said that policy is part of its overall communications rules, not separate from them.\n\nMe on the BBC. Thousands of us walked out, not hundreds :).\n\n""If Amazon truly wants to be a climate leader, we absolutely can not be in bed with fossil fuel companies. Currently we're selling our AI to Big Oil and Gas to help them extract oil more quickly.""#ClimateStrike pic.twitter.com/oGRbZPVIED\n\n— Emily Cunningham (@emahlee) September 22, 2019\nCunningham, a user-experience designer, said she was informed in an October meeting with a human resources executive that she had violated the company’s recently updated policy. Cunningham criticized Amazon’s environmental policy at the company’s shareholder meeting in May, and on social media and in news reports she has condemned Amazon’s work with oil and gas companies.\n\nIn an email, Cunningham wrote that the human resources meeting was frightening, adding that it also made her sad and angry, given the threat of climate change.\n\nCosta wrote that she understands that she cannot discuss confidential business information but that she believes she has an obligation to speak out about the causes of climate change and how to address them. Amazon’s efforts to silence employees’ criticism of its practices are damaging morale, she said.\n\n“I’ve had colleagues, many of them very senior and tenured, say how disappointed they are — that this isn’t the company they thought they were working for,” Costa wrote.",1578008362,t3_ej6gla,/r/Green/comments/ej6gla/amazon_threatens_to_fire_critics_who_are/fcvrcvq/

Photograph: National Geographic Image Collection/Alamy\nDespite the potential for far-reaching long-term consequences, details about the plans are sparse since the government suspended 28 federal laws mandating protections and oversight, relating to clean air and water, endangered species, public lands and the rights of Native Americans, in order to expedite construction.\n\nThe waiver includes the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa), considered the cornerstone of environmental protection in the US, the Endangered Species Act, National Fish and Wildlife Act and Migratory Bird Conservation Act. These laws require robust scientific, environmental and costs analysis before projects can be sanctioned.\n\n“With his wall obsession, President Trump has created an environmental crisis at the border,” said the Arizona congressman Raúl Grijalva. “Through environmental waivers and stolen funds, he’s building a wall that will deplete precious water resources, desecrate sacred sites and destroy the environmental treasures and biodiversity that make the borderlands unique.”\n\nJordahl added: “The wall could not be built without the waiver. Nepa requires the government to choose the least invasive, best option for taxpayers … surveillance cameras could be installed every hundred metres at a fraction of the economic and environmental cost. This wall is an unjustifiable project.”\n\nMore than 100 miles of the new border wall have been slated for Arizona, costing roughly $14m a mile, according to the US army corps of engineers. Thirty-seven federally listed endangered and threatened species live around the Arizona-Mexico border.\n\nA well near San Bernardino national wildlife refuge.\nA well near San Bernardino national wildlife refuge. Photograph: Courtesy Center for Biological Diversity\nThe Arizona stretch will need at least 50 million gallons of water, according to Gary Nabhan, an agricultural ecologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson investigating food and water security on the borderlands. (US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said it was still working with the army corps of engineers to estimate the volume of water required for construction and dust suppression.)\n\nWork is progressing rapidly in the Tucson sector – which includes the 20-mile San Bernardino stretch. A nearby well has been tapped to extract groundwater which is used to make concrete bases to hold the towering steel slats, and for dust control. Crews have razed a large section of privately owned land near the refuge for the staging area and concrete batching plant. There are currently eight wells being used in the Tucson sector for three sections, according to the CBP.\n\nIn addition to the Yaqui fish, water depletion also threatens federally protected Chiricahua leopard frogs, Huachuca water umbel, Mexican garter snakes and Aplomado falcon, as well as the San Bernardino springsnails which are confined to a couple of fragile springs.\n\nA Chiricahua leopard frog at San Bernardino national wildlife refuge.\nA Chiricahua leopard frog at San Bernardino national wildlife refuge. Photograph: Courtesy Center for Biological Diversity\nThe impenetrable bollard wall also encroaches into a crucial migratory corridor where “Sombra”, one of just three known surviving jaguars in the region, most likely crossed into the US from Mexico. In Arizona, 13 state laws have been suspended in addition to the 28 federal statutes.\n\n“It’s painful to see how much flora and fauna has already been destroyed in our beautiful desert,” said Regina Romero, the newly elected mayor of Tucson.\n\n“Throwing billions of dollars into building a wall will not make our borders more secure, but will cause destructive flooding and irreparable damage to migration patterns for many wildlife species only found in the Sonoran desert.”\n\nIn December, the city council voted to join environmental organizations including the Center for Biological Diversity in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the waiver as an amicus brief. (The plaintiffs are appealing the case to the supreme court.)\n\n‘It’s painful to see how much flora and fauna has already been destroyed in our beautiful desert.’\n‘It’s painful to see how much flora and fauna has already been destroyed in our beautiful desert,’ said Tucson’s mayor. Photograph: Courtesy Center for Biological Diversity\n“CBP remain committed to responsible environmental stewardship and meeting the intent of these [suspended] laws to the greatest extent possible while allowing the Government to meet its requirements to secure the southern border,” a spokesman said in a statement.\n\nIn total, 93 federally listed endangered and threatened species live close to the 2,000-mile southern border, which is North America’s most arid region. The native wildlife and fauna, as well as migratory birds and butterflies rely on the dwindling wetlands, streams and rivers for survival.\n\n“It’s the kind of wall – concrete footers, absurdly high, with 24/7 lighting – that Trump has chosen to build which will cause most disruption to humans, wildlife and vegetation, and the effects will be seen across the continent,” said ecologist Nabhan.\n\n“Pumping the groundwater will increase the vulnerability of endangered and threatened species and undo 30 years of work costing tens of millions of dollars by governments and conservation groups to protect water habitats.”",1577611820,t3_eh43tj,/r/Green/comments/eh43tj/waterguzzling_demands_of_trumps_border_wall/fcdnuhj/

fc61d8z,egeibd,"Microplastic pollution is raining down on city dwellers, with research revealing that London has the highest levels yet recorded.\n\nThe health impacts of breathing or consuming the tiny plastic particles are unknown, and experts say urgent research is needed to assess the risks.\n\nOnly four cities have been assessed to date but all had microplastic pollution in the air. Scientists believe every city will be contaminated, as sources of microplastic such as clothing and packaging are found everywhere.\n\nRecent research shows the whole planet appears to be contaminated with microplastic pollution. Scientists have found the particles everywhere they look, from Arctic snow and mountain soils, to many rivers and the deepest oceans. Other work indicates particles can be blown across the world.\n\nThe level of microplastic discovered in the London air surprised scientists. “We found a high abundance of microplastics, much higher than what has previously been reported,” said Stephanie Wrightfrom Kings College London, who led the research. “But any city around the world is going to be somewhat similar.”\n\n“I find it of concern – that is why I am working on it,” she said. “The biggest concern is we don’t really know much at all. I want to find out if it is safe or not.”\n\nAbout 335m tonnes of new plastic is produced each year and much leaks into the environment. The research, published in the journal Environment International, collected the microplastics falling onto the roof of a nine-storey building in central London. This ensured that only microplastic from the atmosphere was collected.\n\nThey were found in all eight samples, with deposition rates ranging from 575 to 1,008 pieces per sq metre per day, and 15 different plastics were identified. Most microplastics were fibres made of acrylic, most likely from clothing. Just 8% of the microplastics were particles, and these were mostly polystyrene and polyethylene, both commonly used in food packaging.\n\nThe rate of microplastic deposition measured in London is 20 times higher than in Dongguan, China, seven times higher than in Paris, France and nearly three times higher than Hamburg, Germany. The researchers do not know the reason for the variation, but differences in experimental methods are likely to be partly responsible.\n\nThe microplastic particles in London were between 0.02mm and 0.5mm. These are large enough to be deposited on to the airways when inhaled and would be swallowed in saliva. Smaller particles that can get into the lungs and bloodstream represent the greatest potential health hazard. These were seen in the samples but their composition could not be identified with current technology.\n\nThe serious health damage caused by the pollution particles emitted by traffic and industry are well known. A comprehensive global review earlier in 2019 concluded that air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body.\n\nBut the potential health impacts of inhaling plastic particles from the air, or consuming them via food and water, are unknown. People eat at least 50,000 microplastic particles per year, according to one study.\n\nPlastics can carry toxic chemicals and harbour harmful microbes, and the limited research done to date has shown harm to some marine creatures. The only assessment of microplastic in human lungs, published in 1998, found inhaled fibres were present in cancerous lung specimens.\n\n“These studies showing just how much plastic is in the air are a wake-up call,” said Steve Allen, at the EcoLab research institute near Toulouse, France, and whose own work has shown microplastic air pollution in remote mountain areas. “The [London research] is a very well done study showing incredibly high numbers of airborne microplastics.\n\n“Currently we have very little knowledge on what effect this airborne pollution will have on humans,” he said. “But with what we do know it is pretty scary to think we are breathing it in. We need urgent research.”\n\nJohnny Gasperi, at the Université Paris-Est, said the research shows a widespread contamination of the air by microplastics. He said the London study showed that microplastic deposition did not depend on the strength or direction of the wind, suggesting the city itself was the most likely source.\n\nMelanie Bergmann, at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Germany, said more research on the potential health effects of microplastic pollution was very important. “We do not currently know what proportion of inhaled microplastics actually penetrates the deep lung,” she said.\n\nThe European commission’s chief scientific advisers said in a report in April: “The evidence [on the environmental and health risks of microplastics] provides grounds for genuine concern and for precaution to be exercised.”\n\nMicroplastics are also found in drinking water and in August an assessment by the World Health Organization found no evidence to date of harm but said more research was needed.\n\nCutting microplastic pollution requires changing how plastic is used and disposed of, said Wright: “You can’t clean it up, so it is about stopping it at source.” Allen said: “This is not a problem that is going to go away anytime soon.”",1577470060,t3_egeibd,/r/Green/comments/egeibd/revealed_microplastic_pollution_is_raining_down/fc61d8z/

The fur holds in a layer of air that is warmed by the body.  It's the same concept as a wetsuit but in that case it holds in a layer of water that is warmed by the body.  That's exactly the reason fur has been used as trim on cold weather gear for millenias, way before fashion was a concern.

fbhaq6b,ectw6y,She said that it creates a thicker layer of air that's in contact with your face (or something very similar to that).  It's clumsy language but that is exactly what I said.  It holds in a layer of air that is close to your face that is warmed by body heat.  With nothing there the warm air that your face generates rises up away from your body and is gone to be replaced by cold air that your body is constantly trying to warm.  The fur provides a thick semi-trapped layer of warmed (by your skin) air.  Again it doesn't have to be fur but fur works well.

I'm from the University of Michigan. The way fur works around the face, by having the fur present on the edges, you increase the thickness of the layer of air which comes in contact with your face and therefore it really reduces the heat loss.""_\n\nIn context, or if put to the question now, I suspect that Dr. Cotel was asking a framed up question, causing her to answer with the specific context of fur. I expect that, much as you yourself say, she would agree the fur is not a magic ingredient in the principals she was sharing.\n\nSo from my POV, we agree (I assume) that Dr. Cotel's statement was clumsy, or at least that it was clumsily used in Canada Goose's propaganda, and we agree (I assume) that the advertisers for Canada Goose are using this statement to justify using fur explicitly over non-animal products (and they were), then I hope we can agree that it's as reasonable to use what you see as a ""hella weak"" dismissal (in the context of the video) of the idea that fur a necessary insulator of coat fringes. ^**=o)**",1576870462,t1_fbhaq6b,/r/Green/comments/ectw6y/i_buy_canada_goose_because_synthetic_coats_cause/fbhckch/

I think it's use in the original video was clumsy and transparently a sales pitch and I think that Mic's dismissal was equally clumsy and felt to be as much a sales pitch.

The last time I bought a vehicle, hybrids were in short supply.

In order to buy an electric vehicle, I either have to order from out of state or the dealership has to do an exchange with another dealership - again, out of state.\n\nFurthermore, dealerships that don't carry ev's as part of their regular inventory might not have trained mechanics for ev's, so the car would need to be towed, potentially, hundreds of miles if it has an issue with the ev system.\n\nI am purchasing an ev, but I fully understand why someone would wait.",1573796443,t3_dw4xqi,/r/Green/comments/dw4xqi/academic_why_do_people_choose_to_purchase_gas/f7k6qe0/
f7hgf3d,dw4xqi,"I noticed some key things were missing or inaccurate in your survey. For starters, the primary reason for not getting an electric car was my inability to charge it given my apartment complex design. Another important factor was the relative lack of safety features at my price point when compared to gas cars. \n\n\nElectric cars are just as bad if not worse for the environment depending on your electricity source. While solar panels may be a viable option near you, in many parts of the country people are getting their electricity from the grid which typically means coal. In those cases, the relative efficiency and lack of gasoline engine in the car becomes completely offset by fossil fuel sourced electricity to charge the car.\n\n\nAlso, the federal tax credits only apply to fully or partially electric vehicles not traditional styled hybrids.\n\n\nOn top of the increased price pushing safety features out of range there's the issues of the cars by design being less safe. If you live in an area with icy winters, hybrid tires an inherently dangerous. The decrease in traction on the tires can improve fuel efficiency by a bit (less than 5 mpg on average) but also makes icy conditions increasingly dangerous. Decreased horsepower, engine cylinders, and slower acceleration vastly improves the fuel efficiency but makes merging and highway driving dangerous. While most of the issues with inherent safety have been fixed many older hybrids have poor design from a safety standpoint. However, older hybrids are still on the market and it's important to note their light weight is key to efficiency but also makes them less stable, slower to brake, and more likely to skid. \n\n\nAlso to buy the carbon emissions offsets for the difference in my gasoline car and the hybrid was $15 a year with generous rounding. That's far less than the monthly insurance premium increase, the extra $5,000 increase in the car cost, or the increase in the loan interest rate. The decrease in fuel costs was noticeable but even if you account for those, the carbon offset was cheaper. ",1573740129,t3_dw4xqi,/r/Green/comments/dw4xqi/academic_why_do_people_choose_to_purchase_gas/f7hgf3d/

Somebody like Bill Gates fits this description.

We must create global systems that do not trade goods for profit but plans and information about how to build things yourself so that people don't have to rely on a single rich capitalist to provide the products we need. A philanthropist wouldn't support the systemic change that would put them on a much closer level with the average citizen.\n\nThis means that global foreign policy must shift. Neoliberalism's ideal of free-flowing capital between countries is backwards. Let people flow freely instead.\n\nOf course, this type of story ignores the potential for a technological development that could reshape every conception of the land.

In my experience they last 4-5 years or so, and I'd expect an electric car's main battery to last much longer than that.   Lithium batteries have about double the number of charge cycles as lead-acid.   \n\nAs far as size, it weighs about 50lbs.   A lithium drive battery for an electric car might weigh several hundred pounds.  An lithium ebike battery of a similar capacity of a car starting battery might weigh about 20lbs.    E-bikes are becoming a thing now because of the better power to weight of lithium.  \n\nPersonally I've been looking for a lithium or other chemistry battery to replace the 12v lead acid in my petrol car since the lead-acid is not very freeze tolerant, and I find my self freezing and ruining a battery every couple years.  Unfortunately, a lithium battery is a few times the price of a lead acid for a petrol car, making them not particularly economically viable for me as a consumer.   I always think to myself ""this winter I'll just be careful, so I don't have to shell out again""     \n\nWhen I had a 300+ volt nickle-metal hydrid drive battery in a hybrid car I had, that battery was fine the years I had that car.

f16s9y9,d7v3h9,">Changing our single-use plastic habits is a key part of these campaigns and other initiatives.\n\nI disagree.  I think it makes less sense to beat against the current and try to change ~10 generations of use-then-discard mentality, when we could be *harnessing* that cultural desire to actually help the environment.  [Compostable single-use items](https://greenpaperproducts.com/biodegradable-cutlery-cutlerymixmatch.aspx?utm_medium=shoppingengine&utm_source=bing&utm_campaign=Shopping%20product_category&utm_term=4580565446241799&utm_content=Arts%20%26%20Entertainment) are a carbon *sink* in as much as every plastic spoon replaced with an organically-derived spoon effectively removes that much carbon from the atmosphere, if developed using similar processes.  And, if combined with [pyrolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis), its destruction results in [biochar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar) which can be added to the soil to [improve soil fertility and sequester carbon for centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar#Carbon_sink).  If the biodegradable spoons are composted, they are a one-time carbon negative (when they replace the plastic spoon) and thereafter carbon neutral.  If they're pyrolized, they're a *continuous carbon negative item*, pulling co2 out of the air and putting it back in the ground, in a form that cannot later be extracted for energy.\n\nThe problem is that the production and distribution of compostable items is not carbon-neutral, but that is changing in places where energy is becoming 100% renewable.  Once energy use at the production level becomes heavily sourced from renewables, if we use compostables as they're meant to then *our bad habits can help save the planet*.\n\nWe need 1) municipal composting or pyrolising facilities, 2) heavily renewable energy in the production and distribution of the items, and 3) profit motive for people to sell these instead of plastics.  We're getting there.\n\nImagine if every fork, spoon, bowl, cup, bag, napkin, newspaper, bit of uneaten food, empty water bottle, every little disposable thing in your life right now was actually made by pulling carbon out of the air and destroyed by putting that carbon back in the earth.",1569222232,t3_d7v3h9,/r/Green/comments/d7v3h9/rethinking_the_convenience_of_singleuse_plastics/f16s9y9/

f0ugtnt,d6n5ir,"Floods are now an annual nightmare in many parts of southern and western India. Valleys in the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala that weren’t considered flood-prone until recently are at risk.\n\nDuring floods and landslides in August 2019, two villages were completely destroyed killing several people, while a year earlier Kerala saw its worst floods in a century.\n\nThese floods appear to be getting more severe. Climate change is causing stronger and more erratic rainfall with recurrent floods in low-lying areas while population growth is putting more people in risky areas. And another problem comes from deforestation in the mountain range where much of the water first fell: the Western Ghats.\n\nThe Western Ghats run for 1,600km in parallel with India’s west coast, from Gujarat right down to Tamil Nadu at the tip of the subcontinent. It is, or was, a picturesque landscape of serene valleys, steep gorges and virgin forests. Yet, recurring floods and landslides in the mountains, hills, and areas downstream (between the Ghats and the sea) show that India must rethink its environmental law to balance the needs of nature and humans.\n\nThe mountains are teeming with life. Though they cover only a small part of India’s total land area, the Ghats are home to more than 30% of the country’s species of plants, fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals, including both wild elephants and tigers. Its combination of unique species and habitat loss means Unesco has recognised it as one of eight global “hottest hotspots” of biodiversity.\n\nNICHALP / WIKI\nClimate change is already having an obvious impact, with unprecedented rains in monsoon seasons and severe drought and dry rivers in summer. And as the human population has grown, people have chopped down the forests and replaced them with spice, tea, coffee, and rubber plantations. Thousands of illegal stone quarries now also operate in the Ghats, where mountainsides are demolished to generate stones and sand for the construction industry. Deforestation and the use of highly destructive explosives mean these areas are prone to increased seismic tremors and landslides.\n\nLarge dams on major rivers offer renewable energy yet also raise another set of environmental problems. In Kerala, many are located in eco-sensitive parts of the Western Ghats, with some dating back to British rule. As demand for energy increases, India plans to build more dams which in turn could lead to massive deforestation and ecosystem destruction. All this makes flooding more severe, as deforestation in the catchment area of a river reduces the land’s ability to retain water.\n\nWhether triggered by damming, deforestation, or exacerbated by climate change, human-induced natural disasters in the region have pointed to a need for stronger environmental protection laws.\n\nHow to protect the Western Ghats\nIndia’s 1950 constitution claims that protection of the environment is a fundamental duty of every citizen, and though it does not explicitly contain a right to a clean environment, legal authority for environmental lawmaking is derived from the document.\n\nOver the years, the country’s central government has enacted various laws that are applicable to the Western Ghats: the Environment Protection Act 1986, the Forest Conservation Act 1980, the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2002 and so on. However, these laws are not implemented efficiently, which makes me wonder if areas like the Himalayas and the Western Ghats⁠⁠—internationally significant ecosystems and biosphere reserves – need their own special laws.\n\nAdditionally, India’s water laws are inadequate. Existing legislation primarily focuses on pollution control, meaning the law has little to say about preventing or even managing floods which result from mismanagement of dams or too much riverside development.\n\nThe problem is enhanced in the case of rivers that flow across state boundaries. Some of the major floods in the past couple of years happened after dams at or near full capacity in one district or state were opened, letting water flow downstream into another area. Recently, a draft dam safety bill has been proposed to address these problems.\n\nSimilarly, discussions over climate change and environmental lawmaking should involve more grass-root level participation. For most people, poverty and earnings still matter more than climate mitigation or adaptation. Hence people’s perception should be moulded to recognise and realise how deforestation or climate change impacts their daily life.\n\nThe Western Ghats are south India’s lifeline, with millions dependent on the range either directly or indirectly. These mountains need protection. However, while new development in the region continues to be human-centric, the entire concept of nature preservation is relegated. To protect the Western Ghats, what we require is an attitude that recognises the significance of these mountains, and that will involve specific laws.",1568940384,t3_d6n5ir,/r/Green/comments/d6n5ir/india_leave_those_forests_on_the_mountains_alone/f0ugtnt/

f0kd78i,d58kto,"Later this month, the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg will visit the UN’s Climate Action Summit in New York. As part of the convention, she has been invited to visit the British artist Michael Pinsky’s work, Pollution Pods, which will be installed in front of the UN building and presents six interconnected, climatically controlled chambers that mimic the relative air quality in cities around the world, from London to Beijing. \n\n\nSince the teenage activist began a humble school strike for the climate a year ago, she has quickly become a household name—and an inspiration for many in the art world. Her message—that we need systemic action to protect our environmental future—has gained enough momentum to earn itself a name: the “Greta Thunberg Effect.”\n\n\nIn the culture world, she has inspired installations like Pinsky’s; portraits by the painter Elizabeth Peyton and the photographer Hellen van Meene; a mural by the street artist Jody Thomas; a multimedia work by Justin Brice Guariglia; and an exhibition by the curator Francesca Pietropaolo.\n\n\n“What is remarkable about Greta is that she suddenly became a huge presence slightly over a year ago and now it seems like she has been there forever,” Pinsky tells artnet News.\n\n\nWhile youth movements have a long history—Pinsky remembers protesting an exhibition that promoted nuclear power at the National Museum of Scotland when he was 11 years old—something about Thunberg has managed to capture the zeitgeist in an unprecedented way. \n\n\nThe Greta Thunberg Effect\nGiven Thunberg’s clear resonance, it is no surprise that she has inspired not only artists, but also curators.\n\n\nAt this year’s Venice Biennale, where climate change is a major theme, the Italian curator Francesca Pietropaolo co-organized a show that explores the issue with artist and curator Phong Bui. And Pietropaolo, perhaps unsurprisingly, cites Thunberg, who declined to be interviewed for this article, as an influence.\n\n\n“Greta is an inspiring member of the new generation,” Pietropaolo tells artnet News. “Her voice has become an important catalyst for change.” Pietropaolo is particularly interested in the positive tone of Thunberg’s activism, which is in contrast to the apocalyptic, spectacular tone of so many others.\n\n\n“I think that Greta’s activism could also inspire a reflection, from a curatorial perspective, on the making of contemporary art exhibitions, taking into consideration their very process in order to evaluate their environmental impact,” Pietropaolo says. Curators could be inspired, for example, to study and reflect upon the environmental footprint they leave when they do their work. “I think of Venice in particular, with its fragile reality.”\n\n\nThe practical impact of Thunberg’s voice is not limited to Pietropaolo. The Dutch photographer Hellen van Meene, who shot Thunberg for the cover of TIME magazine, tells artnet News that after they met, she decided to travel to London and Berlin via train for a later work trip, rather than to take an emission-heavy airplane.\n\n\n“There has been a palpable change of mood in the arts sector, with a real sense of urgency and a desire for action being driven by artists and the wider public,” the director of Tate Modern, Frances Morris, tells artnet News. \n\n\nThe directors of the Tate galleries recently declared a climate emergency and laid out a plan to improve the institution’s commitment to sustainability, aiming to reduce its carbon footprint by 10 percent within four years.\n\n\n“An emergency of this magnitude can easily feel overwhelming, so the voices of people like Greta Thunberg have an important role to play,” Morris explains. “They help provide focus and inspiration, particularly for a younger generation whose lives will be profoundly shaped by this crisis.”\n\n\nSimilarly, the curator Lucia Pietroiusti, who organized the prize-winning Lithuanian pavilion in Venice, has introduced a General Ecology project at the Serpentine Galleries in London, which has committed to reducing its carbon footprint. In 2020, it will be dedicating its entire 50th anniversary year to ecological concerns.\n\n\nAt the same time, Thunberg and others have called upon institutions to break their partnerships with fuel companies such as BP. While Tate Modern ended a years-long partnership with the oil giant BP in 2017, others have been slower to make the transition, and Thunberg’s voice is amplifying the pressure.\n\n\nThe codirector of the activist group Culture Unstained, Chris Garrard, tells artnet News that even through a tweet, Thunberg has played a powerful role.\n\n\n“In just the past few weeks, the directors of the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, and the Science Museum have endorsed BP and Big Oil,” he says. “The impact of Greta’s activism has been that their oil sponsorship deals now look out of date and out of step with the wider sector, and will only do damage to their reputations.”\n\n\nActions and Words\nImages of the young Swedish woman, meanwhile, have become a stand-in for her message.\n\n\nLast spring, Peyton presented a picture of Thunberg at Sadie Coles HQ in London. But the visibility of that work paled in comparison to a massive, 50-foot mural of Thunberg made in Bristol that depicts her submerged in rising floods, with the waterline raised high enough to sabotage her most powerful weapon: her mouth.\n\n\n“When someone gives you a wall, they’re giving you a stage, an opportunity to step up and make an impact,” the street artist who created the mural, Jody Thomas, tells artnet News. When he landed on the idea of painting the young climate activist, Thomas says “it just felt right.” He says his proposal for the wall received the fastest approval of any mural project he has ever done. \n\n\nHis image soon went viral, even making it as far as Thunberg’s own Instagram page, where the activist adopted it as her profile picture. “The fact that the piece went global is testament to the fact that street artists and artists can play a role in visualizing a tricky and contentious issue at the moment that is very much on the minds of everyone,” Thomas says.\n\n\nThunberg’s words have also served as fodder for artists. The US artist Justin Brice Guariglia included sections of a speech she delivered at the World Economic Forum in a courtyard installation presented at London’s Somerset House in the spring. The work, Reduce Speed Now!, was made of nine solar-powered highway message boards, which presented texts about climate change from Thunberg, Bruno Latour, Zadie Smith, and other philosophers, anthropologists, and poets.\n\n\n“When Greta came along, she was like a breath of fresh air,” Guariglia tells artnet news. “Here was this young woman who was essentially like the Lorax,” he says, referring to the Dr. Seuss character who speaks on behalf of trees. “She is speaking up for the next generation, the people that don’t have a voice.”\n\n\nGuariglia says that although he has been making art about climate change for the past decade, it takes an “exceptionally good communicator” like Thunberg to really convey the urgency of the problem.\n\n\n“When I think about my work, especially when I’m working with text, I’m thinking in that same mode,” Guariglia says. “How can I be really pithy? How do you communicate that we’re heading towards 100 million-plus climate crisis refugees? How do you communicate these ideas in ways that the general public would actually be concerned?”\n\n\nIn Guariglia’s eyes, Thunberg successfully gives people new language with which to discuss these “very important, very urgent, very existential” issues.",1568676588,t3_d58kto,/r/Green/comments/d58kto/how_teen_climate_activist_greta_thunberg_inspired/f0kd78i/

ez5y6x4,d02k1q,"I don't think it is a care thing at all. I personally think there are 3 main reasons why the ""green"" movement has been slow to take off in the heartland of the country.\n\n1. Americans were targeted by a massive, well funded miss-information campaign for decades.\n2. Maslow's hierarchy of needs. In most of Europe, you have a much stronger social welfare state vs the U.S. When humans are more worried about ""lower"" needs, it is difficult to get them to care about a threat that isn't immediately visible. American's under financial stress just don't have the time, money, or energy to research climate change. Let alone take action.\n3. Environmentalist have done a horrible job marketing/influencing/speaking to more ""traditional"" men. They have been talking only to half the country for decades, and pointing at the other half saying they are the problem. Many of these renewable energy jobs are honestly tough and bad-ass. I live in Ohio and they are trying to get an off-shore wind-farm going near Cleveland. If I were in charge of a media blitz to build public support, part of my campaign would be showing these workers for the bad-asses they are. Crashing over waves in a boat, climbing a tower, and working on top in safety gear; these are dramatic images of a career field that men would aspire to. I would then talk about how these wind-farms help preserve the environment for their families health. Then at the end of the advert I would talk about how well these jobs pay. Look at how the Military markets to men. They show tanks, helicopters, training in the mud, and other ""cool"" positions. Talk about serving your country and helping people. Then they talk about the fat bonus checks. That speaks to men of all ages. Want another example? Look at how Ford is talking about their electric prototype pickup truck. (Really just a Rivian with a F-150 body slapped on, but whatever. I am just glad they invested.) Ford jumped right to ""Watch our new tough, strong truck tow a million pounds! By the way, it is electric!"" Following examples like these will help engage a larger segment of the population and help get more people behind the environmental movement. I want to be clear, the ENTIRE marketing message shouldn't be directed at traditional men. I am just saying, environmental organizations have ignored or even vilified ""traditional"" men for decades.

David Koch — who was worth some $42 billion — and his brother Charles poured massive amounts of money into funding climate change denial through conservative think tanks and politicians. The Koch brothers founded the political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity in 2004, which is credited with turning the “tea party” into a full-fledged political movement. They also backed “right-to-work” efforts, which aim to weaken labor rights and quash union membership. The brothers made their fortune running Koch Industries, the second-largest privately held company in the United States. We speak with the business journalist Christopher Leonard, who just last week published a major new book examining the business dealings of the Koch brothers. It’s titled “Kochland: The Secret History of Koch Industries and Corporate Power in America.”\n\nTo many of us, the Kochs are old news; but either way, some of the revelations in this report are shocking.",1566922835,t3_cw6km4,/r/Green/comments/cw6km4/kochland_how_david_koch_helped_build_an_empire_to/ey8lk71/

euasoea,cfi34w,"They're diametrically opposed problems\n\nAll technology uses energy and more tech = more energy. Think bitcoin using the electricity of Ireland or similar.\n\nSo Apollo needed 400,000 people (contractors, sub-contractors, NASA etc) to get to the moon. All of their energy needs (fuel for vehicles, houses, food, families) + that of building the rockets, space ports and of course the huge amount of fuel per kg to get objects to escape earth's gravity.\n\nGlobal Warming is the opposite - it's caused by the fuel we use and we have to use less. Not just less fossil fuels but we'll end up having less energy to harness overall. It would be nice if the entire planet could be run at today's levels with only hydro/solar/wind but it can't. There aren't that many remaining hydro/dam sites. Solar and wind need fossil fuel inputs at the build stages. Eg large wind turbines need hundreds of tonnes of concrete in the foundations. Concrete can't be made (currently) with electricity and in any case the chemical reactions give off 1/2 of the CO2. Solar PVC is similar. The furnaces to melt the silicon ingots, the fleets of diesel vehicles to install the solar farms, the aluminium frames for the panels etc.\n\nOnly 2 or 3% of the world's energy is currently from wind/solar. To replace just the electricity (currently only 25% of world's energy use) would need a 10x increase in the total installed wind/solar base and might spike CO2 to 500ppm at a guess.\n\nWe do need to keep trying but EROI for oil used to be as high as 30:1. Solar PVC is at best about 6:1\n\nSo in short to solve climate change we need to\na) Stop breeding as much and have clear aims to reduce (by attrition) the world's population\nb) Have simpler lifestyles (in the West). 3 day work-weeks - less consumption - 1 flight a year if that - carbon taxes etc etc\n\nBut a) is not talked about for religious and jingoistic reasons.\n\nb) Simple steps in the west like sorting your garbage are pointless - we have to take massive steps - but no country or region is going to do this voluntarily nor while others are failing to do so.\n\nMy guess is we won't solve climate change but climate change will solve us",1563630967,t3_cfi34w,/r/Green/comments/cfi34w/we_went_to_the_moon_why_cant_we_solve_climate/euasoea/

I have no issue with anti-interventionist ideas, but nationalism, and the act of denying the rights of people’s because they are not U..S citizens is absurd to me. \n\nIn addition, The “aid” our military renders countries is often worse for them. The Middle East is going to need to be rebuilt from the ground up. We’ve practically put several nations back decades because of our interventionist policies. Yes, Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi were terrible people. But they held their respective regions together. Our intervention, and by extension, intensive use of resources, ruined those regions. Now they are leaderless and full of extremism. The death toll of these dictators has been usurped by the death toll of each extremist group. Note, extremist, not Muslim. Now however, because these areas are lawless and powerless, the peoples of these conflicts are not able to be resilient.

You can argue, effectively, I think, that ousting French colonial interests was legit, and that South Vietnamese political leaders were corrupt, but pretending that the whole thing was a simple matter, free from foreign influence, except for us is just historical illiteracy.  \n\n\nNationalism isn't ""denying the rights of people"" because they're not U.S. citizens.  People who aren't legal citizens, legal residents, or legal visitors are breaking our laws if they illegally enter or remain in the country.  They are entitled to not have internationally recognized human rights violated, but those rights don't include remaining in the country at all, let alone indefinitely.  If they're legitimate asylum seekers, we have a process.  And if they commit immigration fraud, they should be imprisoned. Also, ethno-nationalism is dramatically different from American nationalism.    \n\n\nAnd, just because some of the ""aid"" (not sure why you put in in quotes) isn't effective, doesn't mean the root cause of that result is the aid.  Some places are just fucked up. Beyond all recognition.  You can criticize the U.S. for trying to light a candle in that darkness, if you want, but it just sounds petty.  That's not to say that all the aid is well-conceived, or well-executed, but there's never been a more generous nation in the history of the world.  We agree, at least, on non-intervention (for the most part); Bush was pretty bad; Obama was worse.  Both may have had good intentions, but hubris kills.  Saying our ""intensive use of resources ruined those regions"" is just stupid.  That's a global warming claim looking for data to back it up. Good luck.  And they were full of extremism before.  They're less full of extremism than they were 3 years ago.  Choking off Iran's finances will further reduce extremism - they've been trying to destabilize the region for decades, and unfortunately, Obama helped them.  Also, your ""note: extremist, not Muslim"" is just fucking moronic.  Are any of them not Muslim?  Who are you virtue-signalling to?  Hussein, Ghaddafi, and Assad were all more secular than the various extremist groups, but they were all, and are all mass murderers. Calling anything in the last 20 years ""those regions previous levels of success"" requires some Olympic-level cognitive dissonance. The biggest problem for people in the region has been religious extremism and strife, not the U.S.  The various factions in Iraq, e.g. killed far more civilians than did U.S./allied forces.  FAR more.  It's basically Hatfields and McCoys, but again, stoked by Iran.  \n\n\nRE: sovereignty and defense: wrong again.

A global hectare is an adjusted unit that represents the average biological productivity of all productive hectares on Earth in a given year (because not all hectares produce the same amount of ecosystem services). Biocapacity is calculated from United Nations population and land use data, and may be reported at various regional levels, such as a city, a country, or the world as a whole. \n\nFor example, there were 12 billion hectares of biologically productive land and water on this planet in 2008.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Green/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",1562502968,t1_et63s13,/r/Green/comments/ca5tkh/im_looking_for_collaborators_to_help_me_with_a/et63sfg/
et6efdt,ca5tkh,"My understanding of carbon credits is they're not practical or easy to access for individuals. I may be wrong, and if you know more, I'd love to be corrected. \n\nUltimately I want this project to get to the point where we can do crowd-sourced investments with individuals and businesses so that people collectively buy into a harvests, and get a return on that investment, but that has a lot of moving parts, lots of legal and regulatory issues to resolve, which is slow and expensive. I'm not against it. Not at all. I just don't have the ability to do it right now.\n\nMy short-term goal is to start fundraising so we can do our first plant in 2020, and develop the business from there.\n\nIt's a very simple premise. I made a chrome extension that puts an advert into your new tab page. So each time you open a new browser tab, you raise a tiny bit of money. On average, people open a desktop browser tab 40 times a day. When 10,000 people install the extension, we can plant an estimated 1000ha of bamboo within 3 years. I hope we can get surpass those numbers, but this projection is a bit more realistic for now.\n\nI'm also working on some more traditional ways for people to support (such as kickstarters and donate buttons) but I'm really trying to find something super simple for people to support straight away even if they have no money.

Of course, this then calls into question transparency, unfortunately \n\n\nThe other (conventional) option is to put the credits on market, and then get people to invest by buying the credits(and you retire them on their behalf, since individuals can’t buy, only organisations can, like cool effect)\n\nMy opinion is that since you’re VCS approved you should use the carbon market. People buying credits is the way you obtain revenue to expand operations\n\nJust to reiterate, since you made clear your intention as a non-profit it should not be an investor-yield affair but simply buying carbon credits.\n\n\nI’m not sure I got my point across clearly. Either you could be like Ecosia, using revenue to carry out the project or be like an extension of cool effect, using revenue and selling carbon credits from project to fund reinvestment.

For a rough ball park, we're paying ourselves minimum wage rn so it's not like we're trying to get rich off this ;)  \n\n\nI definitely understand why you would look for something more direct to get the most out of every dollar spent. If you're doing the research, you will find very effective ways to have an impact. A large portion of Wren is about raising awareness and bringing this to as many people as possible. That said, I encourage you to consider [TIST](https://program.tist.org/) instead of cool effect or carbon fund. Cool effect is just buying old carbon credits and selling them. They also take 10%. TIST on the other hand is an ongoing project that *needs* capital so they can plant more trees. TIST has been very successful keeping these trees in the ground growing, and they publish a huge amount of data about there groves much more transparently than most would.  \n\n\nYou might ask: why do we exist if we're recommending that you give to TIST? Great question. First, we hope to be supporting some TIST projects very soon. Then the reason we would take 20% is because we can use that 20% to at least double, if not 10x the number of people who would normally donate to TIST. So for you, it does not make sense to give to Wren—you could give directly to TIST and be quite happy knowing you're donating to something effective. But to us, just helping TIST market would not be effective—we need to create a whole separate website and experience that's extremely compelling so people will give to TIST every month for many years.  \n\n\nSorry for rambling a little, just wanted to clear our full logic.

Blanket regulations aren't nearly as effective as those created by local biologists.\n\nAnd for a president who is largely antagonistic towards public lands, expanding access for sustainable use ensures that the sportsmen (many of whom support him) will fight tooth and nail if these lands are ever threatened by development.",1559929031,t1_eq4y9pl,/r/Green/comments/bx8om4/trump_administration_reveals_plan_to_expand/eqaalus/

The concept was very supported. the reality meant altering the curriculum or removing something to make room. All those parents who supported it? They rejected the proposals because they didnt actually want to alter the curriculum in any real way.\n\nThere's yet another proposal being crafted I think with the idea of climate/environmental studies being more of an elective in highschool than a requirement in various years/formats, so that might finally get the foot in the door. Until then, this support the survey talks about reads to me like cocktail fluff.\n\nAfter all, it's not exactly uncommon for people (myself included) talk all about the ways they want to improve or want things to change in any aspect of life, but when it's time to put the peddle to the metal, not so many are willing to actually alter their lifestyles, habits, or just things they find familiar and therefore secure.",1556057349,t1_ellntqr,/r/Green/comments/bgfysu/most_teachers_dont_teach_climate_change_4_in_5/ellxulj/

They're not magic; they require assumptions, or seeding; Ipsos' assumption is that their sample design is ""conditionally ignorable,"" which is hilarious and unwarranted - as they themselves state, ""the probabilities of selection...are nearly impossible to ascertain in online polling.""  Lastly, they use isay for panel pools, which pays people to participate and has no capability to verify any information you provide them.  I signed up for fun.

You know, we're going to put this $10k on layaway and if you're still at 3 kids by the time you hit 40, it's yours. \n\nIt boils down to this point: one person's right to reproduce will infringe on someone else's right to survive.

egwojet,assg95,It's good to be ready for a hard sell. But reputable solar contractors and installers will always do a site survey and maybe an energy audit to determine how big of a system you need. Do you have a south facing roof? Are there any big trees or buildings south of your house that  could shade the array once installed?  These are things you can discuss with the sales guy. Hopefully they have some technical acumen but beware of the sales person who promises the world. It is also important to understand what you will be getting for the energy produced that you don't consume. This excess energy gets fed back into the grid. Some utilities still have Net Metering which is essentially a 1 for 1 trade.

It sounds like they only tested for the chemicals that would be found in conventional pesticides, and not those found in organic pesticides. Of course they saw a drop in urine levels.\n\n2. Organic food can/do have pesticides too. They're just a different set of pesticides.\n\n3. They don't exactly say whether organic pesticides are ""better"" for your health than conventional. What effects do they have and at what concentrations? From what I understand, you usually need to use more organic pesticides than you would conventional because they aren't as effective. So as far as disease risk, how does conventional vs organic compare?\n\n4. Were they eating the same foods during the week they ate conventional and the week they ate organic? Were the foods sourced from the same location? Different foods need different amounts of pesticides and the amount of pesticides needed will also vary based on where the food is grown/what bugs you need to spray for.\n\n5. You're supposed to get rid of bad stuff in tour body through urine, feces, etc. The fact that they found that in their urine would imply their bodies are doing their job. I'm more interested in how much of the pesticides *remained* in the body afterwards. Would that not be a better indicator as to your disease risk?\n\n6. The linked study had a sample size of 16.

This is because so much land is required to produce every grass-fed steak or chop. Though roughly twice as much land is used for grazing worldwide as for crop production, it provides just 1.2% of the protein we eat. While much of this pastureland cannot be used to grow crops, it can be used for rewilding: allowing the many rich ecosystems destroyed by livestock farming to recover, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, protecting watersheds and halting the sixth great extinction in its tracks. The land that should be devoted to the preservation of human life and the rest of the living world is at the moment used to produce a tiny amount of meat.\n...\n\nThose who claim that “regenerative” or “holistic” ranching mimics nature deceive themselves. It relies on fencing, while in nature wild herbivores roam freely, often across vast distances. It excludes or eradicates predators, which are crucial to the healthy functioning of all living systems. It tends to eliminate tree seedlings, ensuring that the complex mosaics of woody vegetation found in many natural systems – essential to support a wide range of wildlife – are absent.”",1549071861,t1_efhdqsa,/r/Green/comments/alr06f/how_to_go_green_in_2019/efkbh46/

efbvuul,al919e,"Copied from a FB feed from a news source:\n\nThe northern Polar Vortex is a persistent, large-scale, low pressure zone of dense, cold air that rotates counter-clockwise at the North Pole. It is powered by the heat differential between the pole and the equator. In summer, since the poles are heated less than the equatorial regions, the differential is large and the vortex is stable. In winter the differential is small so the vortex is weaker. When the vortex is weaker it becomes very choppy. It can shard into smaller vortexes that can travel south which causes extreme cold events.\n\nThink about stirring a drink. When you begin stirring the water is choppy and bounces around randomly. As the speed of the liquid increases, the choppiness goes away and the flow becomes smooth. This is analogous to the polar vortex.\n\nIncreases in temperature due to climate change effect the poles differently than equatorial regions because of melting sea ice, snow coverage, ocean currents, and other effects. This leads to a smaller temperature differential and a weaker polar vortex. Ultimately, this means that we should see more extreme cold events as the global temperature rises.

Global warming is the increase in *global average* temperatures, which is an important point for your friends, because just because it's cold in one place doesn't mean the Earth isn't warming as a whole. (It is.)\n\nThe contiguous United States covers less than 1.6% of the Earth's surface. A cold snap in the US does not indicate that the world is getting colder. To know what the globe is experiencing on average, you need to know what's going on in the other 98.4% of the globe. The GISSTEMP data set keeps track of average temperatures globally and shows that the planet is warming substantially over time.\n\nClimate refers to the long-term averages of meteorological conditions. Climate change indicates that average conditions in certain areas--- the climate--- is changing. This also won't be consistent in every location.

However, there is quite a lot of verses about protecting and being good stewards of the earth, and that it's the evil ones that will be cast into hell that selfishly and greedily exploit it (and those who exploit other humans).    \n\n\nIt takes some careful logic to navigate idiots like this, but I'd ask her a series of questions like, ""Are sinners going to hell?  Are people who are willfully sinning going to heaven just because they call themselves Christians? (Which leads to either, than are gay people in the church OK?  or then how does the end of mankind come about, because it talks quite  a bit about evil people bringing about the end.)  \n\n\nThe bible is quite clear that it's evil people and ""the antichrist"" who will destroy the earth and lead to the apocalypse.  Ask her why she's ok being on the side of evil that Revelations and Jesus so often speak about.    \n\n\nIf you want to argue with Christians, I'd recommend spending a few hours reading the gospel (matthew, mark, luke and john) and highlighting/saving the passages that are most relevant.  If they try and counter with something from another part of the bible, especially the old testament, ask them which takes precedence, the traditional Jewish section, or the words of Jesus?  \n\n\nI also find this resource really useful:  [https://www.openbible.info/topics/stewardship\_of\_gods\_creation](https://www.openbible.info/topics/stewardship_of_gods_creation)  You can type in a variety of topics.  \n\nAlso, in general, read the good samaritan section.  It applies to so many things relevent to today.  It basically outlines why people like shitty pastors and false ""holy"" leaders like Trump are going to hell, and why a ""dirty foreigner"" can be a better Christian than anyone who claims to be super holy.  You should know that ""Samaritan"" meant somebody from Sumeria, which was like saying the ""Good N-word"" back in the time of the writings.  You should also look up what the other two people are.  Basically, one is a church leader, and the other is descended from the ""Most holy bloodline of God's chosen people"" (a specific tribe of Israel that was supposed to be the most holy).

I live in the SF bay and the number of delivery vehicles around here is insane right now.\n\nHow about a system of conveyance to fill gaps between distribution hubs and customers. It might operate like a municipal utility that anybody could use. Our neighborhoods get water, gas, fiber optic, sewer, etc... Why not a delivery pipe? Think of those vacuum transaction tubes at old bank drive-throughs.\n\nI'm optimistic about the future of online shopping and improved efficiency.

eb5nbqj,a3bw95,"I dont know folks, but this sort of thing gets me a bit angry...\n\nAnd if the creators are here and I'm missing a point somewhere please please please correct me as I really would like this to be true, however: \n\nHow hard is it to actually compress natural gas into a storage cylinder?\nThe video shows them using an air mattress pump with adapters but I can't imagine something like that could put out more than single digit PSI (well under 1 bar). Propane, LNG, etc are (as far as I understand it) in a liquid form in a normal tank/cylinder. As they are drained the liquid fuel boils off to bring the tank back to full pressure (this is why you have to use a scale to measure how much propane/LNG is in a tank, IE why you cant use a pressure gauge as a full tank will have roughly the same pressure as an ""almost"" empty tank.)\nThis means to fill a tank with any meaningful number of joules you would need to get the gassious fuel up to a high enough pressure to liquefy it and that needs some serious business compressors & cryogenic plants (neither of which are exactly consumer items).\n\nResidential appliances use step down regulators to bring the tank pressure down from ~200PSI to ~.5PSI so although yes I am sure you could manually pressurize fuel into a tank at single digit PSI and make it run a device (momentarily), you would however NOT be able to store enough in a tank to really do anything useful. \n\n\nIE:\n\n-You are not going to run your BBQ for more than a minute or two.\n\n-You are not going to drive your scooter to the beginning of the driveway let alone to the farmers market \n\n-You ""MAY"" be able to charge a cell phone if you ran the gas through some sort of fuel cell (An internal combustion generator would be a no-go)\n\n\nPS: this video sent me down a rabbit hole of looking for LNG/Propane scooters. Does anyone actually make them??? Found a few conversion kits online but all had stationary installed tanks, nothing I was able to find has a removable tank (and after looking at the video again its pretty clear to me that was a gas scooter, not LNG).\n\nAgain If I've missed the mark here someone please step in.\n\n\n\nPS:\nAs for safety, I will gloss over the obvious issues with leakage/certifications etc, but here's a big question... How much O2 is going to make it into that bladder? If someone does manage to cobble together a manual pump how much O2 is going to end up in the slightly pressurized tank of natural gas?\nWhat happens when you light the bbq burner if there's O2 present in the tank/lines? does that run back to the tank and detonate it?\nOr are we talking about so little energy here that its really not a concern...\n\nAgain legitimate question that I'm not properly equipped to answer (but I am concerned about).",1544035582,t3_a3bw95,/r/Green/comments/a3bw95/converting_food_scraps_biowaste_into_renewable/eb5nbqj/

A house, car, few dogs, maid, computer, and some other small stuff. I then asked her what she was going to do with the other 1499 million dollars.

e9dlu2n,9vasmt,"Firstly I would like to say that I wholeheartedly believe in climate change and that it is largely anthropogenic in nature, I would however argue that we are oversimplifying the complex nature of our climate system formed through reductionist rather than complexity thinking by focussing solely on emissions figures and a fairly basic understanding of radioactive forcing.\n\nFrom the detailed study I have undertaken on this topic as a passionately concerned citizen of this beautiful planet we all share, including a university degree I do not believe the other GHG to carry the same weight as CO2, due to the relationship between different species involved in various complex ecological niches on our planet and especially on the worlds grasslands which make up 30% of the terrestrial surface of the earth. \n\nAs a result I find the argument put forward in the Vegan philosophy/ideology in particular in to be wrong including in the pseudoscientific drivel in “Cowspiracy” and believe it to be a dangerous distraction to the the most important problem facing us today! \n\nFor my argument I will focus mainly on Ruminants as an example of how the calculations are skewed! \n\nSo, what do ruminants eat and in particular what is in a cows diet? most of it comes from non-human edible food such as grasses, sedges,herbs, vetches etc. with the exception of cattle in feedlots for the last 100-200 days of their lives (depending on breed, sex and production system) and a small number of production systems across the word(the world is bigger than the USA) as I will explain.\n\nEven in the USA where most of the propaganda documentaries have been based most cattle still come from small cow:calf operators with less than 30cows with another large proportion of the supply coming from the dairy herd. \n\nAnd even on supposed monocultures of perennial ryegrass, clover, Lucerne/alfalfa etc.you would be surprised what species you will find due to the beautiful and potent seed bank that lies beneath our feet, in most cases planted species make up less than 50% of a species mix thus contributing far more to biodiversity that’s bland stands of annual crops as would be the case on a solely vegan diet! Not an issue when balanced with appropriate nutrient cycling from “animal agriculture” whilst similarly annual crops of corn/maize harvested solely for animal consumption will cause similar problems. \n\nWe also forget we can harness the capability of ruminants to convert fibrous, non human edible food components into human edible foods whilst feeding the wider flora and fauna in the process, unless you feed all your cattle in one place and grow all your crops somewhere else, thus mining the land in one area and polluting it in another which is a big problem in the USA but please don’t project that on the rest of the world, Kip Anderson I’m talking to you 😊\n\nMost of a ruminants diet comes from perennial herbage which covers the land for 12 months of the year and has been proven to sequester more C02 into stable carbon through organic matter and the formation of soil than annually cultivated crops such as most veggies! Further to this it is a complex ecosystem of microbes in the cows rumen that produce Methane (methanogenic archae) they do this to remove hydrogen ions which unless removed would cause the pH to drop significantly! Perennial crops will also stabilise the Earths water cycles and in turn and when managed correctly should keep water vapour a potent greenhouse gas that is often forgotten about in healthy equilibrium! This is of course unless we ignore the effect we are having on global warming, don’t keep below 1.5 degrees and these water cycles are exponentially disrupted due to warming, and yes I know vapour has a much shorter atmospheric persistent than CO2 CH4 or N20 but that doesn’t mean it is not incredibly important, we also don’t know that just because said GHG are more persistent that they amplify the warming effect of CO2 (we do in theory but that’s it!) and indeed if these levels CH4 or N2O are essential for the various ecological niches on the planet and especially the microbial niches which produce methane as a means of controlling their immediate physio chemical environment? \n\nAlso counter intuitively the more starch and sugars (grains and other byproducts) in a cows diet the more of a particular Volatile Fatty acid called propionate is produced in the rumen, Which acts as a hydrogen sink and hence less methane is produced! \n\nLarge herbivores are also one of nature’s best transporters of nutrients especially across different gradients i.e. moving nutrients up hills, this is also a potential reason why ruminants are less “feed efficient” as they are largely excreting a fermented mix of grasses, herbs and sedges and fertilising the flora and microflora of the surrounding land providing feed to plants and the complex ecosystem of microbial life that live symbiotically with both plants and animals. \n\nThe same microbial processes are at work when plant matter falls on the ground and the microbial process of breaking down this litter also begins, usually beginning with Fungi such as yeasts and mycelium and moving into bacteria and earthworms which in turn produce methane, Co2, Oxygen etc. \n\nThere are also bacteria called methane oxiding bacteria that oxidise methane and hence render it ineffective, there are also microbes that emit methane. In many ecosystems we still do not know what bacteria these are as we are only gaining an understanding of how to identify these tiny microbes using novel next generation genome sequencing technology harnessing the 16srRNA marker. \n\nThe point is we still don’t know 90% of the microbial species in the animals gut and indeed in the soil and the complex interaction between both. \n\nFurthermore variation in CH4 emissions between animals is staggering (80% swings) the calculations used by the IPCC do not account for this nor do they account fully for the sequestration of the various GHG in agriculture, furthermore many of the calculations are comparing apples to oranges, for instance the FAO report that compared whole lifecycle emissions from agriculture and only vehicle emissions from transport, completely misinterpreting the facts and artificially inflating the effect of animal agriculture, this has since been rebutted and an apology by the authors of “Livestock’s Long Shadow” has been issued, however the incorrect figures continue to be referenced and in particular in documentaries such as Cowspiracy and What the health, \n\nSimilarly we are not acknowledging the role of methane in complex ecological niches as a means by which microbial populations alter their physio chemical environments, reducing it down solely to the fact that it amplifies the radioactive forcing of other GHG is too simplistic a view in my opinion. \n\nI only use this specific example as a harbinger for what is a much bigger problem, an oversimplification of one of the most complicated problems facing us, Climate change! \n\nMy point is that if we use poor data like the example above how the hell are we going to have accurate prediction models and thus how are we going to decide the most appropriate actions, in my view this does not mean we should despair and do nothing, rather we should acknowledge the nuance and complexity of the climate system  and allow our argument to stand up to rigorous questioning so the full high resolution picture climate change and how we can solve it can take place, this cannot and will not happen if we do not all use our capacity for formal reasoning and debate, so please correct me but do so by “steel manning” my argument not “straw manning” it. \n\nSo please help me get to the truth through  debate! \n\nAs one of my favourite quotes goes: \n“What is to give light must endure burning” Viktor Frankl\n\n\n\n",1541792566,t3_9vasmt,/r/Green/comments/9vasmt/global_animal_agriculture_is_responsible_for_more/e9dlu2n/

Much like CO2 and ODSs, getting rid of plastic is going to require change that is likely to take longer than 7 years. \n\nYou know that 8 million figure chucked around in news media, it actually comes from a journal article that Jenna Jambeck authored. Her research actually indicated that it could be anywhere from 4.7 - 12.7 million tonnes of plastic, so 8 million could be a conservative estimate. Couple this with the fact that of the 300 or so million tonnes manufactured, ~ 10% of this is mismanaged or improperly disposed of, meaning much of it will be at risk of leaching into the environment (i.e. informal landfilling). \n\nand finally when you look at the three categories of plastic - thermoset (poly prop, epoxy, etc.), thermoplastic (PET, HDPE, LDPE, PVC, PS, etc.) and elastomers (e.g. rubber) - only thermoplastics are recyclable. \n\nThis is a big challenge man.

Drawing on gender socialization and diversity theories, greater female board representation and female chief executive officers (CEO) are expected to reduce the frequency of corporate environmental violations. Empirical evidence in this study shows that firms with greater board gender diversity are less often sued for environmental infringements. In contrast, CEO gender is linked to reduced environmental litigation only in firms with low female board representation. I explore the relationship between board gender diversity and improved corporate environmental policies as a mechanism to explain the reduced litigation frequency. The findings are robust to controlling for reverse causality, propensity score matching, subsample analyses, different variable definitions, alternative model specifications, and industry controls and adjustments. These findings provide important insights to investors, managers, and policymakers into the role of female leadership in public companies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis study seems to investigate a correlation. The first question that comes to mind is whether women directors seek out greener corporations or industries, which from the abstract does not  seem to be addressed. It says ""the findings are robust to controlling for reverse causality"", but it also suggests that what they did is  count women directors and law suits.

However, I'm not so sure that it's as simple as refraining from posting (or even just not posting specific locations).  Yes, at least occasionally choosing not to post can be a key aspect of proper social media use- if use as part of a more proactive approach to social media.  \n\nSuch a proactive approach would include:  Social media posts that visibly model (and promote) appropriate behaviors in the outdoors, support for the posts of others that do the same (""liking,"" ""upvoting,"" etc.), active discussion of outdoor ethics as a part of any social media community, gentle (and friendly) reminders when someone does make a post that visibly shows unethical behavior, and so on.  Providing no information isn't going to fix the impact that social media has on outdoor resources (although selectively withholding some information may occasionally be appropriate).

He asserts methodological flaws in Goodland and Anhang's logic, and claims that the scientific community has formed a consensus that global warming is primarily caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels.[1] Boucher states that the scientific consensus is that livestock contribute 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions - far lower than the 51% claimed by the film.[1]\n\nIt was made by Vegans who have an agenda to push and twist or misrepresent actual facts.\n\nAnother 'documentary' made by the same people has the same problem:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_the_Health#Reception\n>On July 20, 2017, emeritus professor in nutrition Martijn Katan from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam called the film ""propaganda"", which exaggerates the health risks of meat, eggs and dairy, and rather dangerously claims veganism prevents or cures just about any disease, like cancer or diabetes. However, he stressed that everyone should eat less meat than the population currently does on average, and that going completely vegan can be a healthy lifestyle if you make sure you get all nutrients you need (though this is hard to do for young children, for whom he did not recommend a vegan diet) and it's also good for the environment.[17]\n\n>Sarah Berry, Lifestyle Health Editor for The Sydney Morning Herald commented that ""What the Health does make some valid points including concerns about the influence of Big Food on dietary recommendations and about poor farming practices, which can be both inhumane and bad for the planet."" adding that ""The makers cherry-pick science, use biased sources, distort study findings and use ""weak-to-non-existent data...""

He said he put it in his car (all of the recyclables for a 260-suite hotel) and drove it to a neighborhood drop off point. Asked a housekeeper about it and she told me they were just told to put everything from the trash AND recycling bins in the rooms in the dumpster.,1532486904,t1_e2ylbul,/r/Green/comments/91ivx5/the_dirty_truth_is_your_recycling_may_actually_go/e2zh2uc/

It’s legal and low costs in the near term are beneficial for the economy (however artificial that is). The true environmental costs aren’t borne by the driller, transporter, refiner, leaving the impacts to be paid by millions/billions in health care, environmental (water, air) and other costs. \n\nPolicy - GHG and ACC make the first two irrelevant. No more drilling and no more transport via any means should be the immediate policy of any sane administration / society. Since the US doesn’t have that... seriously, renewables are already as cheap or cheaper, conservation makes economic sense, internal sourcing is better for national defense, global impacts already cost billions if not trillions and are going up, and there is no logical reason to make matters worse.

e0p24xp,8r1h84,"OP here-- I didn't have an ax to grind, even if it sounded that way. I approached this genuinely curious about how much CO2 emissions these programs could actually offset. I agree with the point that EVs aren't completely green now but will become green as the grid moves away from carbon-intensive fuels-- and that that isn't a reason to avoid EVs in the meantime. You're building up the infrastructure, and that's a good thing.  \n  \nThat said, the charging isn't the part I found problematic, it was the cars picking up the scooters-- as those accounted for a vast majority of the emissions. You ask who's to say the cars picking up the scooters are ICE? Well I would say:  \n  \n 1) the 'freelance' people who are picking up and charging the scooters are doing it for about $5 a pop. Speaking generally (meaning I acknowledge this is not an airtight argument and there are exceptions), people who own EVs are from higher-income households who can afford EVs-- and in fact EVs are more often owned by people who own multiple vehicles, furthering the idea that they are driven by more well off individuals. This demographic and the demographic collecting scooters for $5 at a time likely have minimal overlap\n  \n2) The vans owned by the companies who are collecting the rest of the scooters I am also making assumptions about, but I would say they are generally not EVs based on the ones I have seen in my city collecting scooters and the fact that not a single one of the companies brag about using EVs to collect the scooters-- which I am confident they would if they were able to just to squeeze out some extra 'green cred.'  \n  \nI appreciate your feedback, both positive and negative. I apologize if it came off like I was on a vendetta against these programs-- like I said in the conclusion, I think they have the ability to be great with a few extra 'green' changes to the companies. But until then, I'd rather they focus on touting their other advantages and not claim environmental benefits that aren't really there.

dypqr7p,8i6ir5,"I don't understand the butter and the cheese vs. the steak.      To make a steak, you have to get a cow pregnant, she has to carry the calf to term, it has to get big for a year or two, then gets to be a steak.  Steak should be several times more CO2 than butter, but it's not.\n\nAfter the calf is weened,  the cow is going to be giving milk.    The cow eats however much whatever for a day, and turns it into milk, a much shorter process than the calving.     Consider how much milk a calf would drink on it's way to being a steak.  \n\nFurther, it takes less energy and waste to make butter than it does to make cheese.    The both start with creme, but to make the cheese a bunch of the water is boiled or evaporated off.   The butter is mainly a mechanical process, and much shorter.   It'd seem the butter should be a lower CO2/kg figure than the cheese just because butter has more water in it and takes less energy to produce.\n",1525893464,t3_8i6ir5,/r/Green/comments/8i6ir5/food_miles_matter_but_they_matter_less_than_food/dypqr7p/

It's a larger fraction of the emissions in the meal it's in, but the meal overall has much lower total emissions.

On mobile there was a thumbnail that made the comparison worse, which had the plate of rice and steak at the same size. Even in the actual visualization the tofu stirfry is about half the radius of the steak dinner. So it's area should be about 1/4th that of the steak plate. But the emissions are closer to 1/10th. All this is without knowing the portion sizes. Is there as much tofu on the plate as steak? My point is that this visualization makes it difficult to compare the relative emissions of the different foods. \n\nAlso what's up with Asparagus, why does it have such a high carbon footprint?",1525939350,t1_dypsncr,/r/Green/comments/8i6ir5/food_miles_matter_but_they_matter_less_than_food/dyqttcd/
dytgk3y,8i6ir5,"I don't know the details behind this graphic, but the only thing that makes sense is for the numbers to be total kilograms of CO2e for each part of the meal. i.e. the beef in a meal is 15.23 kg of CO2e. They write this as CO2e/kg which is technically correct - 15.23 kg divided by kg gives you the unitless number 15.23 - but you'd much more commonly see it written as CO2e (kg).\n\nHowever, the numbers are indeed significantly higher than they should be. Apparently a vegan diet causes about 4kg of CO2e per day, and a ""meat lover"" diet is about 9kg per day. So a single meal being 4-36 is definitely too high. It's possible that they're including something else that's not usually accounted for, but I think it's more likely they're not using a very good source.

dykigth,8hki83,"To be clear: this isn't a safety issue; it's a reactivity issue.  In an AGR, the graphite is necessary to thermalize neutrons, thereby keeping the reactor critical (i.e., ""running"") - rather than containment.  Graphite does swell and crack under neutron bombardment, but apparently it's progressed faster than they expected.\n\nThe worst case, as was said, would be that the reactor never comes back online.  My guess is that this would be political or financial causes rather than anything else: there's nothing _technical_ stopping them from simply replacing the graphite block wholesale; it would just be expensive to do and subject to the usual protests and political obstruction.\n\nWhat would be the consequences of a graphite block failure?  Not a whole lot.  The core itself is cooled with circulating gas, so there's no big risk of entraining chunks of graphite and blocking coolant. \n\nA minor failure (say, a crack chips off a significant portion of the block, which falls to the bottom of the reactor) would cause the core to become less reactive, and they'll have less head room to address power demand surges with control rod withdrawls.\n\nA major failure (enough of the graphite falls to the bottom of the core to render the reactor subcritical, even with fully-withdrawn control rods) would turn the reactor off entirely, requiring a replacement block.\n\nIf they were to clad the graphite in zirconium or ZrH, they'd never have to worry about it cracking again. Designing the cladding to accomodate graphite's neutronically-induced swelling would have been hard when this reactor was designed (1960's), but it's probably quite achievable now.\n\nAs the article states, this is a big blow for British nuclear plans, but again, not a big safety worry.",1525664517,t3_8hki83,/r/Green/comments/8hki83/cracks_in_nuclear_reactor_threaten_uk_energy/dykigth/

dy46qew,8fhjcd,"It's a fair question to ask whether we *should* do anything. Natural dead zones occur all over the world, as the article said, and there has been no evidence presented at this point that this dead zone is not one such. The Caribbean has a large dead zone that is simply the product of poor circulation because no major ocean currents pass through it.\n\n> Also known as “oxygen minimum zones”, dead zones can naturally occur between 200 and 800 metres deep in some parts of the world. But the team found fish in the Gulf of Oman were being “squeezed” into a thin layer near the surface of the water. \n\n> Computer simulations showed the problem is set to get worse, with further oxygen decreases and expanding dead zones expected over the next century.\n\nThe point that ocean temperatures tends to expand dead zones is quite fair, but there's no reason to think that this particular dead zone is tied to a specific human action at this point, even though we can project very soundly that anything that accelerates global warming will also expand dead zones.\n\nAs for your question, there simply is nothing we can do directly. The ocean is too big. Like the idea of sucking carbon dioxide out of the air with giant filters, the magnitude of the scale so dwarfs our technology that it's far-future sci-fi to imagine actually tackling the problem head-on. The best we can do is bioremediation and general anti-global-warming strategies. \n\nMinimizing fertilizer runoff would be a good idea, but that honestly has a lot more to do with riparian eutrophication, red tides, and coastal kill-offs than with anything oceanic, again because of the scale. It's similar to how emptying the Fukushima reactor into the Pacific did all of nothing. \n\nI don't see any indication at this point that dead zones will expand into valuable fishing zones or ecologically critical areas; in other words, I am not at all convinced that larger or more numerous dead zones belong on the list of the most serious consequences of global warming and general ecological destruction.

It's big from a coastal perspective and minuscule from an oceanic perspective. The article neglects to mention that the Caribbean as a whole is a low-oxygen area, which sets the stage for human activity to tip this coastal band into a nearly oxygen-depleted zone. It's a serious problem, but it's important to note that it's also a relatively small problem, fairly described as local. It's not a threat to oceanic ecosystems as a whole. For this zone in particular, the only real solution is to get the entire eastern 2/3 of the US, with a huge industrial agricultural system, to curtail fertilizer runoff. That's the cause, that's the solution, good luck battling the corporate and financial incentives that created the situation in the first place.

If this balance is changed and the overall incoming energy doesn’t equal that out going energy, our global temperature will change. How this change affects our Climate is the concern we must address. \n\nEdit: in his argument he even said “natural balance”. Ask him what he means by “balance”. \n\nSomething balancing usually means it can be thrown off balance. For example, a bicyclist is balancing on two wheels and his forward momentum keeps him balanced. But if he comes to a stop he will lose his balance and tip to one side or another.\n\nGlobal climate is the same. Change the amount of GHGS in the atmosphere and you throw off the “natural balance”. This is why we strive to emit as little GHG as possible. ",1523481292,t3_8bji0e,/r/Green/comments/8bji0e/greenhouse_gases_are_good_lol/dx7goq0/

dwhr6c9,883bv9,"Modern landfills are highly engineered and must go through a rigorous process to get new cells approved. Check out [this diagram](https://www.mwatoday.com/webres/Image/news/07-jul/landfill-enhanced-website.png) of a landfill. Landfills have a thick layer of clay at the bottom. Above that there is a plastic liner then a geotextile mat then leachate collection pipes then gravel then more soil then a ""fluff"" layer (handpicked waste that won't puncture the liner when compacted) and then finally the trash. Landfill designs have to be approved by engineers, environmental scientists, regulators, and county officials. \n\nContrary to popular belief, trash isn't simply dumped and covered. Site personnel must maintain a small working face (i.e.: where trash is dumped and left uncovered). Waste must be covered daily with at least 6 inches of soil (ideally clay). The slopes of a landfill must adhere to the design (4:1 or 3:1 are common), and site personnel check to make sure they are following the design via handheld GPS's, aerial photography, and detailed maps. Landfills are designed to take up a certain footprint both in length, width, and height. The height is known as airspace. \n\nLandfills are subject to stringent environmental regulations. Groundwater wells, methane points/wells, stormwater ponds/outfalls, and leachate lagoons/tanks must be installed, maintained, and sampled. I do environmental compliance for landfills. I have reports due at least once a month for every one of my sites. These reports are submitted to both state and federal regulators who then go over these reports with a fine tooth comb. Site personnel and regulators periodically inspect the site for just about everything, and hefty fines (and sometimes jail time) can be written for violations. \n\nSite personnel must ensure that the design is followed properly, no prohibited wastes are dumped, no landfill fires occur, native vegetation grows, no leachate leaks (seeps) occur, no slopes slide, no excess landfill gas escapes into the atmosphere, no contaminated water leaves the site (stormwater), the groundwater table does not get contaminated, roads are maintained, and so much more! \n\nContrary to popular belief, most waste companies care about the environment. My company got started because they wanted to make sure trash (a necessary evil -- until zero waste really kicks off) is taken care of properly and doesn't pollute the earth or harm people. We currently don't operate many recycling operations (there's a pretty big monopoly right now), but we do operate several composting operations (mostly yard waste -- for now). We still have a long way to go in terms of sustainability, but my company is *willing* and so are most major waste companies. \n\nYes, sometimes your recycling ends up in the landfill. Why? A load was too contaminated (typically due to food and/or too many unacceptable materials -- like plastic bags) and/or the recycler could not find a buyer. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions or want to know more!",1522353467,t1_dwhpt5h,/r/Green/comments/883bv9/what_do_you_want_to_know_about_landfills/dwhr6c9/

dwhp79p,883bv9,"First of all, I live and work in the United States! \n\nA gas collection and control system (GCCS) is what is typically installed to convert landfill gas (LFG) to to electricity, fuel, and/or heat. Most landfills will not install a GCCS until they hit a certain amount of nonmethane organic compound (NMOC). It used to be 50 Mg/year, and now it is 34 Mg/year. At that point the EPA requires a GCCS to be installed. Some landfills, however, will install a GCCS before hitting the 34 Mg/year threshold due to odor issues or LFG migration issues (don't want it to explode or migrate off-site). \n\nThe LFG collected from a GCCS can be converted to electricity (for on-site use or to sell to a utility company), fuel for vehicles (typically for on-site equipment or fleet vehicles), cogeneration of electricity and heat (steam), or for a pipeline. Most often LFG is converted to electricity or cogenerated. Converting equipment and vehicles to be able to use LFG can be expensive. \n\nLeachate is any liquid that drains off the liner of a landfill. I jokingly call it ""trash juice"". Leachate must be treated as wastewater. Leachate is pumped off of the bottom of the liner system and into either a lagoon or a storage tank. It is then transported to a wastewater treatment plant. \n\nA bioreactor landfill decomposes organic waste at higher rates than traditional landfills. There are three types of bioreactor landfills: aerobic, anaerobic, and hybrid.\n\nAerobic landfills use a leachate recirculation system to pump leachate from the bottom of the liner system to the top. Air is then pumped in to promote aerobic activity. \n\nAnaerobic landfills add moisture in addition to the recirculated leachate to anaerobic digestion. \n\nHybrid landfills use both aerobic and anaerobic treatments to decompose organic wastes in the upper portions of the landfills and collect gas from the lower portions. \n\nNone of my sites have a GCCS yet. Two of mine have gone past the 34 Mg/year threshold in the last year, and we are waiting on official EPA confirmation that they will accept the new rule (it was an Obama-era rule) before we install the GCCS. Both GCCS's will be cogeneration systems, and I am working with the local utility companies to see if they want to purchase our excess electricity. \n\nSeveral of my sites have aerobic and anaerobic systems in place. We put leachate recirculation systems in place after having wastewater issues stemming from BOD, COD, and ammonia exceedances, and the system has helped the issue significantly. \n\nNone of my sites have incinerators, and we have not looked into them at all due to the fact that several of our site locations have issues with air quality (not stemming from the landfills but from manufacturing and coal). I myself have not made up my mind on incinerators since I've never toured one (there are none in my state). \n\nI can't say much on ""black bag waste"" and burning it, but I can say something about dealing with ""black bag waste"" with landfills. Landfills must perform a certain number of random load inspections daily, and site personnel sort through a load to make sure no hazardous waste is present. Any hazardous waste must be approved by state environmental authorities and GPS-tracked. \n\nWastes deemed hazardous at municipal solid waste landfills (MSWL) include lead-acid batteries, used motor oil, oil filters, tires, any appliances with CFC's, liquid waste, PCB's, radioactive waste, biomedical waste, asbestos, corrosive wastes, explosive wastes, and CRT's. It should be noted that household waste is excluded from being hazardous, so if a household throws away these things *technically* (but not really) they can. \n\nHope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions!",1522351710,t1_dwhmsqc,/r/Green/comments/883bv9/what_do_you_want_to_know_about_landfills/dwhp79p/
dwhplqm,883bv9,"There's no one ""right"" answer to how much a capped landfill settles over time. It depends on how much organic waste is in the cell, what type of slope is used, and if there are any leachate recirculation and/or gas collection and control systems in place. A landfill with lots of organic waste will settle significantly overtime, but a landfill with lots of non-organic waste will still settle but not as much. Landfills must be looked after for at least 30 years after they close, and a good bit of the organic waste will decompose during this period. To be honest, we don't know about the long-term settling of landfills due to the fact that so much of what goes in the landfill won't decompose for thousands *or millions* of years.  Landfills that have leachate recirculation systems and/or gas collection and control systems in place typically settle at a faster rate than those that don't due to the fact that these systems increase the rate of decomposition and remove gases. \n\nAccording to [Waste 360](http://www.waste360.com/mag/waste_landfill_closure_longterm), ""**90% of the settlement will occur in the first five years, although it may continue for 25 or more years at a slower rate**"". \n\n",1522352071,t1_dwhnl35,/r/Green/comments/883bv9/what_do_you_want_to_know_about_landfills/dwhplqm/
dwhv92t,883bv9,"It depends on the facility and the technology they have at the MRF (materials recovery facility). From what I've experienced (I used to work for a recycler), a MRF will do a visual inspection before putting a load on the conveyor belts. If they see too much food, styrofoam, or plastic bags they will send it back to the hauler. Sometimes the hauler will hand sort it, but most times they will dump the load at a landfill. Handsorting is painstaking and can take days depending on the load size. I once handsorted a rolloff and it took 12 hours. If a load makes it onto the conveyor belt, it may get rejected if the machinery gets clogged or breaks down due to food or bags getting in the gears or food dirtying the belts. Most newer MRFs are automated but still have people handsorting towards the end. Single stream is still the easiest and most cost effective since only minimal sorting is involved. \n\nWashing out recyclable containers is VITAL to the process. They don't have to be 100% free of food but clean them off as much as possible. \n\nUnless the trash is taken to a sorting facility (not a MRF), all of it will end up in a landfill unless the landfill has a legal recovery operation (scavenging), but scavenging is illegal in most states. Sorting facilities are very rare in the United States. My state has one. All the waste goes through it (no sorting whatsoever), and the compost and recycling are separated from the landfill waste.

dwj4s5w,883bv9,"It certainly depends on the type of recycling facility and the market. I can't speak for everywhere but the recycling company I used to work for would send 35% of its waste to a recycling facility (97% of that got accepted -- but I don't know if it all went to a buyer), 10% went to a composting facility, and 55% went to a landfill. The recycling market is incredibly dependent on the price of oil and *obviously* demand. When the price of oil goes down, the demand for recycling goes down since companies will simply create new products when it is cheap. \n\nApproximately 0.02% of the waste dumped at my company's landfills comes from a recycler. I looked up the waste receipts from the landfills this morning. Take that number with a grain of salt, because even recyclers produce landfill waste outside of their intake.

dwi63de,883bv9,"That's so insightful! \n\nHonestly, I think making these processes and requirements for each area visible to the public is vital to improve recycling rates. Most people just don't know they have to wash out containers or that getting it ""mostly right"" could send an entire load to the landfill. I can't tell you how many roommate arguments I've had over recycling. Honestly though, it's not their fault. Recycling lists and requirements for most cities aren't that easy to find and are so vague that it's hard to know you're doing the right thing unless you do your research. \n\nWe need to make it lower effort for people to recycle correctly. For most people, it's a no-brainer, but what regular person wants to spend 30-60 minutes researching the nuances of their local recycler and what they do and don't accept?\n\nWe have all this amazing technology, but that can only take us so far.

dwj5ce4,883bv9,"Communication and outreach is key for recycling success! The recycling company I used to work for was always trying to find new ways to make sure our customers knew exactly what can and cannot be recycled. We would emphasis not recycling styrofoam, cleaning containers, not recycling straws and paper cups, and not dumping food waste in recycling bins. If you can't find a recycling guide for your area look up one for a big city near you. Most recycling in an area goes to one MRF (or a set of MRF's). All the recycling within a 1.5 hr drive of me goes through one MRF before being sold to actual recyclers. \n\nFinding ways to easily reach out to the average customer was incredibly difficult, and like you said, what average person wants to dig through the internet to try to figure out what recycling is accepted in their area? We found that emails, adding notes to utility bills, social media campaigns, tv commercials, and poster campaigns helped. \n\nI mostly worked with recycling with my old company. Now I mainly work with landfills, but my company is looking to push more into the recycling and composting market once this whole China fiasco calms down. Most of our landfills have a yard waste composting area, but none of them have a full organics composting *yet*. \n\nChanging the behavior of adults is incredibly difficult. That is why it is important to instill recycling (and environmentalism in general) practices at a young age. My elementary school taught me all about recycling and how to be an environmental steward. I hope other schools still do this! ",1522420855,t1_dwi63de,/r/Green/comments/883bv9/what_do_you_want_to_know_about_landfills/dwj5ce4/

The plastic lids should be fully recyclable.\n\nMy take is that a vendor by  law must be responsible for their manufacturing process. They shouldn't be able to retail anything unless they can accept it and reuse it, or fully recycle it: cardboard boxes, tin and aluminum cans, styrofoam, lithium batteries including the product itself like TVs, computers etc. While the argument is that costs will go up, the counter is that society shouldn't reward bad behavior that negatively impacts the environment.

dtce60n,7tgjtc,"Like many items, coffee cups are a sandwich made of different layers of materials.  In the case of most take out coffee cups, there are both paper and plastic materials in the layers. While it is technologically possible to separate these layers, the cost of doing so makes selling the separated parts unfeasible.  This is true for many items and different localities. From a technological standpoint almost all man-made items are recyclable, but the cost of turning a manufactured product back into a raw material makes it financially unsustainable. Glass, and styrofoam are two other examples. The cost of transporting glass to the recycling center is a challenge (which many states overcome with a glass bottle deposit), and with styrofoam, the small amount of plastic left from the remelting process also makes it cost prohibitive.  Most of the places in the US that have high acceptance recycling have high landfill fees.  In the center of the country where there is enough space to dump trash, the economics only support basic recycling, which is usually cardboard, mixed paper, and plastic 1-4 (that's the number inside the recycling symbol on a plastic container). These are things that are easy to collect, bundle, and resell. I would also like to add that ""hopeful recycling"" is bad for recycling as a whole. This means that if you are not sure about the recyclability of an item, throw it in the garbage, rather than hoping it can be recycled.  Removing contaminants from the waste stream slows down the recycling process, costing the recycling center time and money.  Also, the item gets thrown into the garbage by the recycling center anyway.  ",1517100246,t3_7tgjtc,/r/Green/comments/7tgjtc/stupid_question_why_arent_take_out_coffee_cups/dtce60n/

dsf8ia9,7p1imy,"If you look at just one part of the equation you will miss the bigger picture which is far more important. \n\nYes, distance travel particularly by jet produces a lot of CO2 though a relatively small percentage of the total emissions worldwide.\n\nBut it's important to look at the benefits that travel bring to preservation and conservation. I don't think it's hyperbole to make the claim that without distance air travel entire species and ecosystems would disappear.\n\nParticularly in the developing world it's the revenue from tourism that drives preservation. Let's use Rwanda as an example, a single gorilla trophy can be worth $5,000 on the black market. It's the realization that through tourism that a live gorilla is worth far more than that that incentivizes the community to protect rather than exploit.\n\nCertainly not all tourism is good, what I call ""industrial tourism"" in places like Cancun and Cabo is not great for the environment but the reality is far more nuanced.  We need to encourage more Costa Ricas and discourage more Cancuns.\n\nHaving said all of that fuel costs are the biggest cost airlines have no control over they are probably the single biggest interest of the airline industry in cost reduction. You can see that with the 787 Boeing approached the industry with 2 options prior to development... a plane that would cruise at just under mach 1 (taking a couple hours off of a US to Asia flight) or a more fuel efficient plane... fuel efficiency won. \n\nDiscouraging distance travel to places that need the income from tourism to promote preservation can be disastrous.",1515516544,t3_7p1imy,/r/Green/comments/7p1imy/is_there_such_thing_as_sustainable_travel/dsf8ia9/

It's just as dangerous to push your ""we need to focus on the root of the problem"" argument while also contributing to the rhetoric that the status quo of polluting, consumerist societies will never change. And even if these societies don't change, those billion dollar government funds are evidently functioning fairly well as a contingency plan, to the extent that it has people innovating and creating groups like Climeworks. \n\nAdditionally, I believe that the graver ""moral hazard"" are the politicians who don't abide by the precautionary principle and thereby also contest the validity of global warming arguments. Action is better than inaction in a situation such as global warming, and I think that any relevant ""morals"" boil down to just that. Any sort of argument which implicitly or explicitly advocates for inaction in regards to reversing climate change is the greater moral hazard - in reference to the lives of our children and grandchildren. \n\n^ This would suffice as a brief response to Professor Smil's point that only 40% of emissions can be captured by CCS systems - action on the 40% is better than inaction on the 100%. Furthermore, the 7-year time difference between our two videos needs to be underlined - Professor Smil is basing all his conclusions only on *storage* of CO2, while Climeworks are talking about redistributing and using CO2 for commercial and energy use. Technology has come a long way since Professor Smil's talk, and his conclusions should absolutely not be viewed as the ""end-all"" for CO2 management. \n\nLastly, the self-interest of humans lasts only for the duration of their own individual lives. Ideally, we would want to provide a marriage between this self-interest and the long-term interests of humanity, which is precisely what the Climeworks does - it helps to lower CO2 concentrations for future generations while providing capital gains for individuals in the short term. \n\n",1514172635,t1_drq582z,/r/Green/comments/7lqb2g/can_we_suck_enough_co2_from_the_air_to_save_the/drq6umm/

dq0hgo7,7duasf,"I second zxcvb's statement. There is a lot of misinformation. Every well-to-wheel comparison of hybrid cars (especially non-plug in) I've seen says they are less polluting overall, including the production, use and disposal of the car. \n\nThere have been studies which show that full electrics (with much larger batteries) are more polluting when run on a high mix of electricity derived from coal or other dirty, inefficient means, [such as is common in some US states](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/power-plants/?utm_term=.f67440d1d0ac).  But this is certainly not the case in all places. \n\nI think (some) hybrid cars are a good economic choice for anyone right now. Most of them will provide a return on investment over the life of the car. Full electrics can be a little more questionable. I suggest you do the math if you're looking at two cars that get different mileage ratings, see how much money you save by driving, say, 100,000 miles in one vs. the other (fuel cost = [x miles] / [mpg] * [$/gallon of gas]) or the epa provides [this handy tool](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/findacar.shtml) for looking up these stats for most cars.\n\nThat said, I would argue that a *smaller* non-hybrid car may be more environmentally friendly than a larger hybrid. The embodied costs in production are lower, it should get better gas mileage than the larger non-hybrid, and all wear items should generally be smaller and may cost less (brakes, tires, oil changes). For example, I might choose a regular toyota corolla over a camry hybrid, both economically and environmentally.

dpw3flj,7cm0fj,"In short: no\n\nDisclaimer: I don't live in the UK and I've never earnestly shopped for batteries, so this is based on my knowledge of battery backup systems in general.\n\nBasically there are 2 problems here: \n\n1) you can't just ""plug it into a plug socket."" Your home's power system is not meant to source power from one socket in your house and distribute to other sockets. It is meant to come from the central hub of your breaker panel. You'd have to tie into this. Secondly, there has to be some sort of control for switching between battery and grid, which would need to be hard wired into your system. You ~~can't~~ *shouldn't* just throw another device onto your system which supplies power or you will likely get all sorts of hell. This is why the power wall and the like come with control systems that are hard wired into your system.\n\n2) Any reasonably sized battery backup is going to be large. Even lithium batteries would be pretty heavy if you want 5+ kWh of storage. So unless you consider a few hundred pounds of battery, inverter and control system portable, there isn't physically any option to provide this.\n\nMy suggestion: Take advantage of the lower rates when possible by doing energy heavy tasks at night like laundry and dishwashing. Although I assume you probably already do this if you;re looking for next steps. ",1510802206,t3_7cm0fj,/r/Green/comments/7cm0fj/any_portable_economy_7_batteries/dpw3flj/

dq0fk84,7cm0fj,"The premise of what you're talking about is kind of like an Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for computers. UPS systems aren't really meant to be charged and discharged regularly, but in theory i guess you could use one like that. Alternatively you could rig up your own setup with a few deep cycle batteries, an A/C inverter and a charger. \n\nThe problem with all of these systems is that they aren't tied into your home, meaning you'd need to plug in your devices into the other system to run off of it. Also, they likely won't be very efficient. Battery charging and conversion to A/C might be less than 75% efficient which probably negates most of your savings on electricity. \n\nIn short: I don't think there's any way to economically store power at night from the grid for day use (on the household level), even if your electricity price was halved at night. You're almost definitely better off 1) reducing your daytime energy needs flat out (by increasing efficiency, etc.) and 2) as I said earlier, scheduling to do high energy tasks at night.",1511029297,t1_dq01dz2,/r/Green/comments/7cm0fj/any_portable_economy_7_batteries/dq0fk84/

dpfow1u,7b3nhv,I think this is part of the solution but not the silver bullet. I think the faster solution is Carbon Farming. The two best ways to capture CO2 is by growing grass on land and kelp at sea. Then by feeding those two things to ruminates that convert it to manure that the earthworms then take below the soil surface sequesters than carbon faster and cheaper than any Direct Air Capture plant we can engineer. The kelp is a key part here because it converts CO2 to biomass 5 times faster than any terrestrial plant and it pulls the CO2 out of the ocean (which is the planet's largest carbon sink) and reduces ocean acidification. Feeding kelp to ruminates also can reduce methane emissions up to 95%. ,1509992816,t3_7b3nhv,/r/Green/comments/7b3nhv/could_this_be_the_boost_we_need_to_fasttrack_co2/dpfow1u/

From my limited research I have found that it was banned because it's relation to its THC containing cousin and maybe the cotton/timber industry put in some work (money) to help it get banned. I did this research about a year ago but I found that the US was allowing 4 or so states to grow industrial hemp as a sort of test run. My home state Oregon being one of them. Around here there are a LOT of recent farming entrepreneurs growing the thc containing cousin that was recently legalized. (Yay) and the THC growers don't like hemp growing near their crops because they can cross pollinate and make the THC crop seedy. I don't know how people are dealing with that, I just know it's a major concern for some. Now, one of the biggest problems is production. You can't just take a pile of hemp and bring it to the existing paper mill or textile plant. It's got to have its own facility because the process is different from making paper from trees or clothes from cotton. These production facilities would/will cost loads of money and they would be for hemp only. I think right now hemp growers have to ship their hemp to a facility.

do8drq3,75nsrl,"Seaweed _is_ solar energy, mediated through biology.\n\nBiofuels are a known energy source, and have been used for millennia.  The problem is that there's only so much capacity that they provide, and based on readily available options, the United States supplanted current-production biomass with fossil fuels _in the 1880s, and has never looked back._  Other countries have their own cutover dates, but fundamentally, humans use far more energy than could be sustainable sourced through biological activity.\n\nI'm particularly aware of this as it was one of my own hopes for future fuel sourcing a few years back.  The maths simply don't add up.\n\n**I'll note that this article has absolutely no yield, productivity, or inputs values.**  All it tells us is the size of the US DOE grants.  Dollars aren't fuel yields.\n\n[The intractable problem of biomass for fuels is HANNP / photosynthetic ceiling](\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/2cvap7/the_intractable_problem_of_biomass_for_fuels_is/), as I wrote when I first realised the sheer futility of this (and of how well-known the problem was, at least among the reality-based community).  A far better and sobering treatment is Jeffrey S. Dukes, **""[Burning Buried Sunshine](https://dge.carnegiescience.edu/DGE/Dukes/Dukes_ClimChange1.pdf)""** (PDF) (2003), which goes into the details of how our fossil fuels formed, over what time periods, and how much ancient _and current_ biomass production those represent.\n\n**Humans _already_ claim 40% of total plant growth, and adding our fossil fuel consumption on top of that boosts by another 20% again.**  Get this:  _people use massive amounts of energy relative to what is available in the biosystem._  In the link above I pencil out the land area requirements for various biomass options (though seaweed isn't among them), and the land requirements are prodigious.  _More_ than the total land area of the US in several cases, more than total ag land in most others.\n\nI've looked at [biofuels](https://np.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/search?q=biofuels&restrict_sr=on) a few times, with various claimed breakthroughs.  The results have always been underwhelming.\n\nEven _modest_ fuel replacements, such as air travel and transport (about 6% of US petroleum consumption) don't pencil out. \n [A Boeing biofuel ""breakthrough""](https://np.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1wo2hl/boeings_biofuel_breakthrough_less_than/) turns out to be ... rather markedly less than that.  Fortunately there we actually _do_ have yield data, and we can work out total land requirements _for aviation fuel alone_.\n\nAt 75 gal/acre-yr (mean of range) and 16 billion gallons of aviation fuel consumption in the US (2013 BTS RITA estimate), 21.3 million acres would have to be under cultivation. That's about 330,000 mile2, or a region 577 miles on a side.  On the map, you could start in Shreveport, LA, head west to Hobbs, NM, north to Denver, CO, east to St. Joseph, MO, and south to Shreveport again, traversing seven states and completely bounding two (Kansas and Oklahoma).\n\nIn another estimate, algae farms _might_ provide US fuel needs -- if the Pacific and Atlantic coasts were lined with facilities their full length and extending 60km seaward.  Something tells me that won't happen.\n\nThe problems aren't carbon emissions (as /u/Gravitationsfeld notes:  biomass _is_ carbon neutral), and other emissions are likely no greater than present combustion fuels.  **But total yield is the overarching limitation.**\n\nSorry to burst any bubbles.",1507751725,t3_75nsrl,/r/Green/comments/75nsrl/why_seaweed_not_solar_may_be_the_energy_of/do8drq3/

I've been following this story since the 1970s, through promises of ethanol, or nuclear power, or breeder reactors, or biofuels, or tidal power, or wave energy, or...\n\nAgain, the truth is that **people use massive amounts of energy relative to what is available in the biosystem.**  Massivly more than is abundantly available.  If you want a metaphor for the present situation within the field of ecology, compare it to [whalefall](https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/faculty/csmith/Files/Smith%20and%20Baco%202003.pdf) (PDF) -- the sudden appearance, or discovery, of a _temporary_ abundance in an otherwise stark space.\n\nThere are options.  Solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, biofuels.  Small amounts of tidal power, possibly.  Possibly, though I'm not a fan, nuclear, either for a while, or with new technological development and some _serious_ risk-mitigation, nuclear.  How civilisation adapts to a drastically different energy mix and availability will be a major factor.  Patching the system with storage, standby fuels, and dispatchable _load_ rather than _supply_ are likely to be a large part of that.\n\nHumans have gone from ~10 GJ/yr energy to nearly 400 GJ/yr in the US and other advanced nations.  That's a 40x increase in net energy throughput.  It's made a tremendous amount possible, but it's also put increadible strains on sources and sinks.  And that's to supply _five percent_ of the world's population.  There's roughly a billion people enjoying advanced lifestyles presently, another six who'd very  much like to.  The resources don't exist to support that, and we're looking at another three to five billions being added by mid- or late-century.\n\nThe question to me is how this is all going to come crashing down, what will be left, and if anything remotely resembling a modern high-technology lifestyle will exist.

There are 'lots of nutrients' even in the deserts of the world, there just aren't the various combinations of variables needed to properly sustain life.. ..on these levels, in these forms.. ..w/*out* an investment *towards* making them more harnessable. \n\nDeep pumping systems that bring the nutrients from the ocean floor and up to the surface waters *such* that they can be harness can allow for a possible option. Inexpensive? most definitely not, but.. possible? possibly. I, for one, think it's worth trying out,.. within limits. I believe the benefits could outweigh the cost ... when a larger view is taken.\n\n> Those are found near river mouths, upwelling regions, and elsewhere that you find the proper mix of things.\n\nThese are clearly an ideal spot, but they have major limiting factors; shipping industry for one, but also, harnessing them *for* 'industrial' ends damages the ecosystems [that naturally utilize them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River_Delta#Biosphere_reserve) [link 2](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/special-features/2014/12/141216-colorado-river-delta-restoration-water-drought-environment/)\n\n> The tone you may perceive as a lack of optimism I characterise as a sobering dose of realism and having looked at the situation we're facing. I've been following this story since the 1970s, through promises of ethanol, or nuclear power, or breeder reactors, or biofuels, or tidal power, or wave energy, or...\n\n\n> Again, the truth is that people use massive amounts of energy relative to what is available in the biosystem. \n\n*biosystems*? yes. Definitely. I've run the numbers *many* times myself, last night-included while doing research on /r/switchgrass and /r/miscanthus.  back of the envelope calculations in my head basically, but, the acreage required to meet a city's energy requirements (calculated it off of statistics I was finding / know off the top of my head per the city *I* live in, but it's pretty par for the course).. ..using switchgrass and/or miscanthus..  ..it makes an impact, definitely, but by no means meets the energy requirements in a relatively close proximity of the city limits. \n\nObviously a switch to a more energy-dense crop-type like algae or 'other' could increase that, and, with a horribly imbalanced system that's no where near economically viable.. or realistic.. *could* it be done? yeah. Is it by any means 'natural'? no.. ..but, then, neither are the roofs (solar), yards (geothermal), various open spaces (say, windmills mounted above express/free ways and interstates?), etc.  *bio*systems, maybe not, but then, going a *singular* approach towards energy capturing/harnessing and conversion is a bit nonsensical, imo. *Sure* the world could be powered by just solar/wind/geothermal/tidal/etc .. *possibly* even biomass *if* open-ocean systems are viable.. ...but, any single source is foolhardy. A 'mix' is the most idea.. and preferably a mix that compliments itself as well the resources available in the closer market.\n\n\n> Massivly more than is abundantly available. \n\ndepends on what you mean by 'abundant', 'available', and 'massively' ... but, there's an awful lot of [thorium](/r/thorium) around the world\n\n\nIf you want a metaphor for the present situation within the field of ecology, \n\n> compare it to whalefall (PDF) \n\n*Kind* of ironic given that [this story](https://www.livescience.com/52587-missing-giant-poop-is-hurting-earth.html) was literally the last thing I read/posted before opening this message to read :)\n\n\n> There are options. Solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, biofuels. Small amounts of tidal power, possibly. Possibly, though I'm not a fan, nuclear, either for a while, or with new technological development and some serious risk-mitigation, nuclear. \n\n/r/SolarEnergy, /r/WindEnergy, /r/Hydroelectric, /r/Geothermal, /r/Biofuels / /r/Bioenergy /r/Biomass etc .. as well, /r/nuclear and /r/thorium  ... I'm an avid follower of each of these industries, and attempt to do what I can where I can when I can within them.\n\n> I'm not a fan, nuclear, either for a while, or with new technological development and some serious risk-mitigation, nuclear.\n\nI agree. I.. ..have a complex opinion on nuclear that, when distilled to a *much* more refined approach, am a very *big* fan/advocate of it.. but, even then, with it playing a *part* of a healthy mix per other sources. *Each* has their role, imo. ...depending on where, when, how, and in-what-form they're being implemented. Certainly *not* a simple subject to more-concisely expand upon.\n\n> How civilisation adapts to a drastically different energy mix and availability will be a major factor. Patching the system with storage, standby fuels, and dispatchable load rather than supply are likely to be a large part of that.\n\n/r/EnergyStorage too.. I idealize a 'mix' per storage, but with biofuels (processed 'properly' and in stages per what makes the most sense given the market and other variables (/r/anaerobicdigestion /r/pyrolysis /r/gasification in general) .. but with biofuels playing *a* role to ***compliment*** more intermittent renewables (solar & wind mainly... tidal to a degree), leaving the materials for electrical storage (batteries basically) free for more mobile applications. ..but, even there, nature has shown that it's pretty hard pressed to come up with a form of energy density much denser than a hydrocarbon chain.  Nuclear aside, of course. \n\n> Humans have gone from ~10 GJ/yr energy to nearly 400 GJ/yr in the US and other advanced nations. That's a 40x increase in net energy throughput. It's made a tremendous amount possible, but it's also put incredible strains on sources and sinks. And that's to supply five percent of the world's population. There's roughly a billion people enjoying advanced lifestyles presently, another six who'd very much like to. The resources don't exist to support that, and we're looking at another three to five billions being added by mid- or late-century.\n\n.. emphasis on...\n\n> The resources don't exist to\n\nMultiple articles published even *this* week relating to wind and wave/tidal power being able to single-handedly provide the energy requirements of the planet, let alone geothermal (essentially 'everywhere' if you can dig deep enough) and solar (obvious limits here being average sun exposure per an area).. ...and, then, of course, breeder reactors transmutating U-238 to more fissile forms of U and Pu, as well, Thorium into more fissile forms as well (U-232 mainly, of course, but 'others' are created within the process as well).   There're 'plenty' of resources available to provide/meet the energy demands of every human on the planet... *at* the top 500m's levels.. ..though, not without drastic alterations to the current landscape.. ...in more ways than one.   ..and, to do so would even *farther* alter it from those populations.. ..having access *to* the metaphorical 'whalefall' *of* that energy being more easily accessible to them.\n\n> The question to me is how this is all going to come crashing down, what will be left, and if anything remotely resembling a modern high-technology lifestyle will exist. I'm not particularly optimistic on any of these points. Not a hard doomer, and I don't want to see things crash. But I've little sense that there's a real alternative.\n\nI've certainly spent my fair share of time scrolling through and reading the posts at /r/collapse /r/overpopulation and 'similar' natured subs over the years.. ..and I teeter totter on my optimism for the human condition.. ..one thing I'm sure of, the current system isn't going to work for the long run, but, then.. isn't that what projects like the original article are invested in to potentially adjust?\n\n> Particularly when even those who are paying attention are subject to wishful thinking and denying the fairly obvious.\n\nwho *isn't* subject to 'wishful thinking'? and 'denying the fairly obvious' is a matter of perspective. If risks weren't taken, advancements would be fewer and farther between.. ..if optimism or 'hope' isn't at least a component of it, then why even exist in the first place? \n\nCapitalism does, inherently, have a level of risk involved.. ..and, well, capitalizing on resources is kind of what life does.. some forms more sustainably than others, granted, but.. adaption is also a pretty big thing that 'life does' .. ..and it'll be doing it *long* after we're no longer around. ...for better or for worse.\n\n",1507784534,t1_do90r7v,/r/Green/comments/75nsrl/why_seaweed_not_solar_may_be_the_energy_of/do94r36/

There are 'lots of nutrients' even in the deserts of the world, there just aren't the various combinations of variables needed to properly sustain life.. ..on these levels, in these forms.. ..w/out an investment towards making them more harnessable.\n\n**Ocean vs. land deserts:**  Oceans lack nutrients.  Arid land deserts lack water.  Frigid land deserts want for temperature and sunlight, generally.  Life requires a _balance_ of factors.  Remove a critical input and _you get far less life_.  Lieibig's Law.\n\n**Deep pumping:**  Takes _energy_.  There are natural deep-pumping systems:  upwellings, currents, etc.  Those are driven by the ocean's thermal systems, which is to say, ultimately, the solar potential falling over the oceans.  _A whole lot of energy._\n\n**Existing high-production marine environments:**  I'm simply stating where you'll find productive marine ecosystems, and note that they _are_ active _because_ of the nutrient availability.  That's the environment you'd have to re-create at mid-ocean ... somehow.  And yes, humans are grossly overextracting from the oceans well beyond sustainable rates, and have been for decades, if not most of the 20th century.\n\n**Back-of-the-envelope calculations:**  It's a really useful excercise.  I highly recommend [GNU units](https://np.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1x9u0f/gnu_units_utility_and_energy_resource_calculations/) for that sort of thing, it's hugely flexible and dynamic.  If you start running units conversions, you also start getting a sense for just how units and quantities compare.\n\nAnd biomass just doesn't add up.  (Or you've got to drastically reduce populations ... somehow.)  I turned up a study from Oregon, assessing corn-based ethanol, canola-based biodiesel, and cellulosic wood-based ethanol found that:\n\n> [T]he maximum amount of added energy that could be generated (net of energy used in production) for these biofuels is estimated to be 0.16% percent for corn ethanol, 0.41 percent for cellulosic wood-based ethanol, and 0.07 percent for canola biodiesel. Even with all three biofuels produced in Oregon at the maximum levels indicated, the total energy contribution would be only about two-thirds of 1 percent of Oregon's annual energy use.\n\nFrom [Biofuel Potential in Oregon](http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/8268/SR_no.1078_ocr.pdf).\n\n**Algae:**  I've looked at that as well, and frankly, it doesn't look viable either.  Realise you're talking _massive_ grow-tanks _the size of entire states_.  Roughly 1500 km * 100 km * 2 if you're looking at an off-the-coast option (and ... what of everything that's already off those coasts, and maintaining that large a marine infrastructure, and hurricanes and storms and shipping and ...).  In practice, mixing, nutrients (again:  algae need something to grow on), waste removal, _parasites_ (a massive issue), pump fouling, and more.  Canola, hemp, and switchgrass are among your most productive other options, and ... they're still limited.\n\n**""Abundant"", ""available"", ""massively:**  In quantities roughly commensurate with current usage, rates, and costs.  There's no mystic sense about this.  I strongly recommend Vaclav Smil's books on the topic, which are hard-nosed and realistic, without being complete fatalistic and depressing.  _Energy and Civilization_, out this year, is based on his earlier _Energy and World History_, (1994), which I've read and was _excellent_.\n\n**Energy and storage mixes:**  I'm not claiming I've got the solution, but I've been in and about the subject for a few decades, and have read a great deal, including Lovins, _Reinventing Fire_, the Stanford study by Jacobson and Delucchi, MacKay's _Without the Hot Air_, Tom ""Do the Math"" Murphy, and many more.  There are some basic parameters, and you cannot simply hand-wave them away.  The idea that the future will reflect our present energy realities is ludicrous.  And a huge amount of the ""but doom and gloom has been called before"" arguments are quite frankly deceptive and manipulative bullshit. I've read those too:  Simon & Khun, M.A. Adelson, Milton Friedman's lecture on the energy crisis.  All either venture straight off into fantasyland or ignore or misrepresent earlier statements or warnings.  There's the EROEI question to deal with (I've studied and had exchanges with Charles Hall on that).  And more.\n\n**Wind & Wave/Tidal:**  Wind actually works pretty well, _where it is abundant_.  Much as rain works well for electrical generation if you can pile a whole mess of it up off a watershed, at a dam, and place a few 700 MW turbines at the low end of a headrace.  But laying out mini-turbinettes catching every last single raindrop's terminal kinetic velocity doesn't work:  you're expending _far more_ in capital outlay than you're getting back in energy.  Where wind is _not_ abundant, it makes relatively little sense to try to capture it:  small-scale rooftop wind turbines, unless you simply _cannot_ get electricity any other way, make little sense.  The wave and tide estimates _apply across the entire ocean_.\n\nConsider that Hoover Dam doesn't generate electricity on the Colorado River by putting turbines along its entire length, but by concentrating a few of them _at the dam itself_ (and, yes, a few other hydro facilities on the river such as Glen Canyon).  **You have no way of similarly collecting all wave or tidal energy from the world's oceans.**  You might be able to create a few tidal impoundments where the topography and bathymetry are suitable, but that's _small potatoes_.  [Capturing _all_ the tidal energy of the San Francisco Bay would not even provide all of San Francisco's _electricity_ needs](https://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1wefio/false_promise_a_rising_tide_may_lift_all_boats/), let alone total energy consumption including fuels, or of the greater Bay Area.  **That's how freakishly much power humans use.** \n\nGeothermal also has limits.  It's actually _mostly_ highly utilised, something that suprised me when I investigated it.  Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, _The Philippines_ (_really_ suprised me), and the United States all make heavy use of it.  The large untapped fields are significantly in the Rift Valley of Africa (and could be a real boon), and the Yellowstone Caldera in the U.S., presently off-limits as a National Park.  The _total_ thermal throughput of Yellowstone is about 6 GWt, which at _total_ capture and a high Carnot efficiency _might_ yield a maximum of 3 GWe of generation.  That's a large plant, but the total US capacity is over 1,000 GWe.  Again, something's got to give.\n\nAnd that's _concentrated_ geo at existing hotspots.  It is possible, yes, to drill deep, expensive, risky wells into bedrock to extract ... some ... of the available thermal energy over about 40 years, after which you've extracted _all_ the useful heat and have to wait a few centuries for it to recover.  I got curious about a positive report about an Australian project, which turned out to be not quite so rosy on closer inspection.  But a cautionary tale about the risks of R&D into novel energy technologies:  ""[How Not to Write about Renewable Energy: the Habanero Geo / Energy Watch edition](https://ns.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1wpa90/how_not_to_write_about_renewable_energy_the/)"".\n\nI've also [explored thorium, briefly](https://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/23nvqs/peak_thorium_ad_62000_not_with_this_math/).  If the boosters can't even get their basic maths right, I'm ... dubious.\n\nA bit of acquired insight from an old fart:  there's a hell of a lot of puff in the alt-energy press.\n\n**Subreddits:** some may be useful as an introduction, though I'd suggest you not look to them for a deep education (a few contributors excepted).  There's a literature on this stuff, and your library, or Google Scholar and Sci-Hub, are far more useful generally.\n\n**Truth is not a matter of perspective.**  Not the truths we're talking about here.  Risks can be arbitraged.  Many have been.\n\n**Capitalism:** Much of it is little more than deceptive bookkeeping.  To a far greater extent than I'd realised.  Unbooked natural capital writedowns, socialised externalities, profiting off of negotiating strength and advantage, and pushing risks off to others either in present or future times.\n\nLife can adapt.  But whalefall communities die out no matter how much they do so.\n\nNet total health is dependent on sustained useful metabolism throughput.  You can increase the efficiency, but where the metabolism falls, you're going to see less capability.\n\nSee Lesley White (anthropology), Darwin-Lotka (biology), Herman Daly, Joseph Tainter, Jeremy England.",1507800145,t1_do94r36,/r/Green/comments/75nsrl/why_seaweed_not_solar_may_be_the_energy_of/do9b9fw/

In this study, we present an organic waste conversion achieved through a two-step process: first, fallen phoenix tree leaves were transformed into carbon microspheres via the hydrothermal method; second, a porous carbon material was prepared from these carbon microspheres through an activation process using KOH. The carbon microspheres were analyzed by using several characterization methods, including X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method. The porous carbon material exhibited excellent supercapacitive performance with specific capacitances of 367 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g and 240 F/g at a current density of 20 A/g. The capacitance retention of the material was 91.7% after 2000 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 20 A/g.",1504799781,t3_6yo3kv,/r/Green/comments/6yo3kv/new_process_converts_biomass_waste_into_useful/dmot0un/

dmktnyt,6y1fz0,"Here in Canada it has been slightly different. In federal (national) elections about fifteen years back, voting for a non-mainstream ( there are three national and one based only in Quebec) party meant that the party would get funding proportional to their share of the vote. It made a significant difference, and was quickly shut down by the Conservative party once they were elected. \nBut the question of whether to vote your ideals or strategically is one that gets a lot of noise. During our most recent provincial election, the vote was split three ways; Liberal (rightish), New Democrat (leftish), and Green. The Libs had been in power 16 years and managed to lose several seats and ended up with 43 (one shy of half). The NDP got 42. And the Greens got three. The Libs were given first shot at forming a government. They were defeated on their budget and the NDs were given a chance. They were forced to approach the Greens, who turned down a coalition. The Greens have agreed to support the NDs on money bills, but to vote any way they find best on any other bills. Their leader has said that the goal is to force civility and compromise, and to encourage good ideas and amendments from all parties to make proposed bills sounder.\nVoting Green in your last election did  NOT cause the Dem's to lose. They did that all by themselves by alienating those voters who felt the Greens better reflect their values. Voter suppression and gerrymandering took care of the rest. \nHere, we are able to regularly send one party or another on an extended time out without trashing government.

Highest use is to recycle.\n\nCardboard is usually also pretty early on in the cycle - best to recycle that if you can. \n\nNewsprint is usually nearing the end of useful recycling, the fibers are quite short. Usually made from a healthy amount of recycled material. Pretty much OK to compost.\n",1502297763,t3_6slu5c,/r/Green/comments/6slu5c/ethicallyenvironmentally_is_it_preferable_to/dldwst3/
dleuudp,6slu5c,"So, I should start off by saying I don't know nearly enough about this, so I guess take this with a grain of salt, and I'll try to look into it more. :)     \nBut I've heard recycling can be very hit or miss depending on where you live. I've heard a lot of it gets shipped overseas to be recycled (which is not only extremely bad for the environment, but also leads to human rights issues), and a lot of it gets sent to landfills instead of being recycled at all. And while I'm not sure how much of that is true, I try to default to composting, if I'm able to, just to be on the safe side. If I compost it myself, I *know* it's being composted, I *know* it's not being shipped overseas, and I *know* that no one is being exploited in the process.    \n\nEdit: Here's a quick and interesting [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZy08fMFyb4) on the topic, if you want to watch. :)    \nEdit2: Have also heard [Plastic China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0Kif9cugQ0) is a good documentary on some of the issues of waste and recycling as well, but I haven't watched it yet.",1502337609,t3_6slu5c,/r/Green/comments/6slu5c/ethicallyenvironmentally_is_it_preferable_to/dleuudp/

dlh4bvh,6slu5c,"This is a good answer. To add, some papers will have inks that compost won't like, so you should recycle if possible. \n\nNewsprint can sometimes be one of these sources of bad ink.

However.... finding places to fill your veggie tanks along the way (at a reasonable price) is going to be a challenge. \n\nCheckout skoolie.net",1501078986,t3_6pjxzo,/r/Green/comments/6pjxzo/biodiesel_school_bus_travels_across_usa/dkqua01/

dkutyha,6pjxzo,"That ""may"" be easier said than done for two reasons.\n\n1) Most restaurants (in my part of the world at least) already sell/give their grease to a service which collects and processes it commercially. So giving it or selling it to you may be a problem with existing service contracts as it ""does"" actually have commercial value.\n\n2) PPO/SVO can be run straight in a converted vehicle. If you blend it with real diesel (say 20% bio 80% dino) and watch your air temperature you can also run it in most non-converted vehicles.\n\nHOWEVER to run WVO straight in an engine is going to require either A) heavy processing or B) Light processing AND heavy conversion. \nThis is a very deep dark rabbit hole and you are going to want to do some serious research.\n\nMain points of interest concerning WVO: You need to heat it so it becomes liquid, then hold it undisturbed at high temperature of a few days to both boil off any moister and to allow settling of the big chunks. After that most people use a centrifugal processing step to remove more mechanical contaminants before running it though staggered filtration.\n\nOnce the oil is ""dry"" and free of mechanical contaminants you may want to run it through a titration process to figure out how much catalyser will be needed. After running through that process you would add the catalyst (to prevent it from turning into soap) while agitating the tank at specific temperatures for specific times. After processed it would be filtered again to remove the remnants of the previous reaction, tested and would then be ready to burn.\n\n\n",1501270220,t1_dkulpdr,/r/Green/comments/6pjxzo/biodiesel_school_bus_travels_across_usa/dkutyha/

My understanding is the ocean is thick with tiny chunks of plastic, which are very difficult to remove and are in fact quite bad for ocean life.    \n\nSecondly, building a fleet of special-purpose platforms doesn't seem very green. Can we find a way to retrofit this onto already-extant ocean-going vessels? Or attach some kind of modules to the sides of drill rigs that can do the same function?  \n\nThird, prevention is really key here. This plastic doesn't just spontaneously appear, some human somewhere chucked it into a waterway or ocean.  Can we find that guy and get him to stop?  Seems a lot easier than engineering filters for the whole ocean.   \n\nWe always talk about a carbon tax as being helpful in changing energy consumption patterns, but it could also drastically alter the economics of cheap plastic, which could see people getting a lot more serious about recycling or not even generating the plastic in the first place.",1499191379,t3_6l6ca3,/r/Green/comments/6l6ca3/the_floating_platform_concept_filters_the_plastic/djrvxiq/

dj8gzi4,6ipae0,"1. **An energy-saving power switch.** This energy-saving power switch draws zero energy when the switch is flipped off. Plus, it declutters the kitchen from the wandering cords of unplugged devices. \n\n2. **An LED night light.** Lunara is UL approved and rated to last 40,000 hours. So, according to Lunara, if you use the night light for 10 hours a day, it'll last more than 10 years. LEDs are around 10x more energy-efficient than typical incandescent lights, so the company estimates the cost of the Lunara at $0.25 to operate.\n\n3. **Bright, energy-efficient light bulbs.** These Philips' light bulbs are bright and energy-saving alternatives to traditional 100W incandescent bulbs that use more energy. The company estimates you'll save $336 in energy costs. The bulb should last a little over nine years (based on three hours per day on). These GE 13-Watt bulbs are also a great option.\n \n4. **A smart thermostat.** Programmable thermostats can save up to $150 a year in energy costs when used properly. Not only does this thermostat work with Amazon Alexa voice control, but it's also the first one to earn an Energy Star. Since your thermostat supposedly controls half your energy bill (more than appliances or electronics) it's a great place to focus your attention if you want to cut down on use and costs. Using the Nest app (yes, there's an app), you can view how much energy you use and why, so you can make the right decisions for you using your own energy history. \n\n5. **An LED desk lamp with an auto-off timer.** This desk lamp looks good and saves energy; it uses durable LED lights that should last for 25 years and utilizes a one-hour auto-off timer, so if you accidentally leave it on, the lamp will turn off automatically and save you the grief on your energy bill. \n\n6. **A low flow showerhead that will use 75% less water but still have great flow.** Niagara's Earth Showerhead saves money by using up to 75% less water than traditional ""low-flow"" showerheads typically found on the market. Though it promises drastic water usage reduction, it also utilizes patented pressure compensation technology so there's always a consistent flow rate regardless of available water pressure. It's also guaranteed for 10 years. According to government data, putting in low-flow fixtures like this can reduce your water consumption by at least 50% and save you about $145 every year.\n\n7. **LED and dimmable under-cabinet lights** These under-cabinet lights are 12W / 900LM altogether, which can replace 24W fluorescent tubes that are more traditionally used, and save you 80% of the energy. Plus, you can dim the lights to any brightness level with the dimmer switch to accommodate the time of day and your preferences. \n\n8. **A quick, steam-leveraging pressure cooker.** Though the thermostat may be the biggest culprit of a high energy bill, appliances aren't too far behind. This pressure cooker uses far less energy than many appliances by cooking food quickly and also by leveraging the pressure powers of steam to do so. \n\n9. **Solar-powered outdoor path lights.** Once you start using solar power to make your home more energy-efficient, you'll likely wonder why you haven't been doing this for the outdoors (where the sun is most abundant) for as long as you possibly could have. \n \n10. **A bathroom scale that turns off when you aren't using it.** This digital glass bathroom scale has an easy-to-read LCD display and an automatic shut off to save you energy, especially for all the time when you're not using it, anyway. \n\n11. **A hair dryer that uses 75% less energy than normal.** This hair dryer promises to dry hair in under 10 minutes and use 75% less energy. How? It's manufactured with a patented brushless motor that uses an armature instead of a carbon brush. The brushless motor is what uses 75% less energy.\n\n11. **Solar-powered patio lights.** Like we said earlier, solar gear for the outdoors just makes sense. These hanging, waterproof lights are long-lasting with a 800mAh rechargeable battery that can work continuously for 8-10 hours once fully charged. If there isn't enough sunshine, replace the rechargeable battery. \n\n12. **Solar-powered and LED security lights.** This waterproof solar wall lights parameter has about a 4-6 hour charging time and works for up to 8-12 hours. There are adjustable modes: sensor and dim light mode, sensor mode, and always-on mode. ",1498106207,t3_6ipae0,/r/Green/comments/6ipae0/13_energyefficient_home_upgrades_that_pay_for/dj8gzi4/

Do the Math With Vaclav Smil\nDescription | Vaclav Smil is one of the world's top trackers of resource trends, energy transitions and more. In 2009, I jumped at the chance to do an hourlong onstage conversation with him at a festival of science and technology organized by the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics.   We talked at one point about the scale problem in confronting global warming. Every solution runs up against the issue of scale in dealing with tens of billions of tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually.   He runs the math and builds a devastating critique of CCS as a meaningful contributor to blunting climate change. I still haven't seen  a rebuttal that holds up. Let me know if you have.  Here's the full video from the Perimeter Institute: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhD8rWOWLDI  Here's my 2009 Dot Earth post on this chat: http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/19/smil-on-hummers-hondas-meat-heat/  Keep track of my climate reporting now at http://propublica.org  More from Vaclav Smil:  http://vaclavsmil.com http://pirsa.org/index.php?p=speaker&name=Vaclav_Smil\nLength | 0:07:10\n\n \n\n \n \n \n****\n \n^(I am a bot, this is an auto-generated reply | )^[Info](https://www.reddit.com/u/video_descriptionbot) ^| ^[Feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=video_descriptionbot&subject=Feedback) ^| ^(Reply STOP to opt out permanently)",1496721152,t1_diin50x,/r/Green/comments/6fg7rr/a_plant_1000_times_more_efficient_at_co2_removal/diin59v/
diox7aq,6fg7rr,"In the case of CO2 from coal, n.gas, tar sands, petroleum, etc... ie, 'fossil fuels', even if the emissions are captured ('impossible' when you think about it from the perspective of capturing the tailpipe emissions from every vehicle on the road), you still have to deal with the damages caused by extracting them from the ground to begin with, then transporting them, etc.  Fracking in ground water, coal ash issues, mining chemicals entering the environment, those pictures of open pit mining and what Canada's tar sands look like from above, etc... not to mention gas leaks, oil spills, etc.\n\nThat's all *before* burning. Get into burning it and even if the emissions are cooled, condensed, and piped to underground wells to be stored, it would drastically increase the price of generating energy from those sources and, in the process, make them all the *less* cost-competitive vs energy sources that don't have this added cost. \n\nA *way* of thinking about it would be like comparing coal to solar... from a generating perspective....then mandating that coal have carbon capture, transport, and storage systems put on them like many solar/wind/etc have necessary battery storage systems attached to them. The cost of these facilities drastically goes up.\n\nBeyond that, there are, quite simply, 'better ways to do it'.\n\nIn the case of the article, this technology makes sense for denser environments.. ..ex: those smog-filled pics of downtown Beijing and such. Areas where denser populations (thus emissions) exist, and where having cleaner air is beneficial to the health of the population, but planting 'green roofs' all over the city not only isn't realistic (for 'whatever' reason), but also isn't 'dense enough' *in* its /their filtration capabilities to adequately remove the emissions (aka: pollution) from the air.\n\nUsing a facility like this *outside* of urban environments really seems 'silly' to me. I'm not one to go against scientific progress, but when it comes to allocating a fixed quantity of capital for something like this vs, say, something like an energy-producing field of switchgrass? ..that also helps to build soil, retain water, reduce runoff, capture & produce large quantities of 'easily' separated hydrocarbons ... ...and filter the air as well? \n\nObviously it won't be as dense as a mechanical operation like this, but the energy harnessing capability combined with the environmental filtration aspects 'makes more sense' to me vs, say, large fields set up with these in them... run solely for the purpose of cleaning the air that's continually getting polluted because the local population has yet to switch energy sources.\n\nGrowing something like switchgrass, for example, does both: cleans the air *and* allows for a switch in energy sources... so that there's less pollution in the air that *needs* to be removed in the first place.\n\nVaclav Smil (great name!) doesn't go into this in the video above but.. ..well, this is in addition to that.

See if wind sourced energy is available in your area and if so switch. Use reusable produce and grocery bags. Shower for shorter times and with cooler water. Purchase in bulk and bring your own containers instead of buying everything in plastic.

Also, if you filter for region and building type using the raw data you are left with insufficient statistical sample sizes which implies a lack of data. \n\nI think feet should be held to the fire for energy savings by requiring the PROVING of the savings.

di77vip,6dr29r,"I live on the Oregon coast, so I've always been fascinated with ocean conservation. I've done some volunteering with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife as well as with NOAA Fisheries.\n\nI'm also very interested in climatology. I have a contract for meteorology for the Air Force, and Ill be leaving in a few months for that. I've been doing lots of research on [MetEd](https://www.meted.ucar.edu/training_detail.php) to prepare myself, so other similar sources would be nice. After the Air Force I hope to come back to Oregon study environmental science. As far as what facet of the field I'm not sure, but climate change is something I'm concerned about so climatology seems plausible. \n\nOn top of that, as I mentioned in the post, I've started a recycling program at my high school. Plastic pollution is something I've actively combated in my community. I love the potential for what The Ocean Cleanup could accomplish and this may be something I pursue.  \n\nAll in all I'm very fascinated by the many many sides of environmentalism. I enjoy reading any type of literature which is written from a sustainable point of view. Whether this is small ideas to make our daily lives eco-friendly, papers informing me of crucial scientific concepts and their relation to our world, articles discussing developing environmental solutions, or journalists reporting on the policy changes as governments react to our impact on this planet, I am fascinated. One fairly mainstream source that regularly covers the environment is vice news. But I'd like to broaden my sources and find different point of views.

dhq6pft,6bwisp,"ACC is one of the most studied, provable scientific concepts of our time.\n\nDenial does pattern after greed (lobbyists in article), ignorance or faith, wherein the science is understood, but the person can't accept the conclusion as, to them, god would never harm them or their home (save for the rapture in christianity, and most aren't equating ACC with an early rapture sign yet).\n\nMost of us likely haven't found a good consistent presentation to convince people, but here are a few of mine that work sometimes to raise comprehension. You've likely used some/all yourself. \n\n**Snow/cold**\nWhile this is weather versus climate, it is part of climate change. Think of a bathroom shower curtain. When the room is cold and you run hot water the curtain wants to rush in the bottom. This is *similar* to a cold snap further south - while not exact the added heat is pulling the cold arctic air south. \n\n**Climate always changing**\nYes. But this is different because of the rate of change. Natural processes take centuries and changes are very small in that time. ACC is much faster.\n\n**CO2 hasn't raised that much**\nIt has gone from ~270 to 410. That's almost 50% more than before the industrial revolution. That's a lot.

dgrm7m1,67j4o9,"Awesome idea. IMHO the big problems are global warming, overfishing, habitat loss, and free plastic in the environment. I'd love to know what others think are good focus topics. \n\nGlobal warming: Remember some people don't get the benefits of being environmentally sustainable purely for it's own reward. Also a lot of backlash by conservatives in the US who don't believe it's a thing. In this case it's good to focus on the real and growing economic benefits and independence that sustainable energy technologies provide.\n\nOverfishing: I think communicating success stories for sustainable stock management is a great way to approach this issue. http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/peg/publications/fact_sheet/fact20sheetmsa20success20stories202011finalpdf.pdf, Also institutions like the Monterey Bay Aquarium publish their Fish Guide to sustainable fishing.\n\nHabitat loss: I'm at a loss. Though I think when approached as a land conservation issue conservatives can get on board with this issue. Though I'd love to hear more from others.\n\nFree Plastic: This issue. I think most people are aware on some level that plastic pollution in the environment is causing problems, but making any headway is difficult. Plastic is on almost every product we buy, and we buy a lot of products. I have an art project about this!

Also, when we put reusable bags at the checkout (they're normally at the entrance) many more people purchased them than normal. I think most people who don't use the plastic bags for other purposes see the reasoning to use reusables but just don't care enough to remember them. So, if you can find a way to get people to remember them, that makes a massive difference. I don't think the issue is in the design of the bags themselves or people not caring. Somehow incentivizing it more than $0.05 per bag would help.\nMaybe more signage explaining the impact of single use plastic bags and how many can be saved?

You can attack him for lots of things but I really think calling Clinton an intellectual is just such a funny sticking point for you. \n\nTo the rest, you're pushing an abject fallacy which is that Clinton's failed career as a senator (voting for the Iraq War but repeatedly attempting to pin the blame for supporting Iraq on Trump) secretary of state (Yes, Benghazi, but also NATO campaigns to arm ""moderate rebels"" who are now Daesh and other radical extremist groups) made her much more qualified than other candidates. It's not about how many titles your party gave you to help advance your career, it's about whether you fit the times and situations in which you're called to serve. Abraham Lincoln who probably had a month of formal schooling, was a much, much better president than, say, William Howard Taft, who, like Clinton, was an incredibly well-educated lawyer.\n\nHillary Clinton spent her whole life trying to be the first woman president. Along the way she didn't pick up the skills that make someone a great leader such as empathy and humility, and as a result she's been relegated to the ash heap of history. We'll see what happens with Trump, but I think it's time you abandon your worship of her because the American party system is going in a a much more populist direction on both the left and right and the Democratic Party is going to have to adapt and try to figure out how it can reclaim the people who have felt abandoned in states like Iowa, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Florida.",1490318904,t1_dfbt4fy,/r/Green/comments/60va72/king_the_democratic_party_seems_to_have_no/dfc0axp/
dfc9725,60va72,"Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts. Shall do the same, not as a tit-for-tat, but because of enjoyment in this conversation. \n\nHRC is an intellectual, although I never used that word and find it interesting that this has become a sticking point in the thread. An intellectual like HRC, who I know personally along with Bill, along with Gates, and many prominent republicans, suffers from a degree of analysis paralysis and communication to many who simply disengage due to her language. She is one of the brightest people around, and her failing is the population not working at her level and many voters being more concerned with women being homemakers (as was the case in AK with Bill). That she carried the popular vote should indicate that she wasn't that wrong, and, directly, that many in swing states voted against their interests for illusion, be it empty promises, the illusion of regaining utopia, hatred of (group), and sexism (especially by demure women and older men who repeatedly said a woman shouldn't be president). Ignore that the media provided DJT with a blank canvas to pontificate and constantly inflated issues that weren't voiced to the same level for others.\n\nDJT doesn't care about the nuance or details, he's proclaimed this, and he's proud of this. He does play extremely well to the population at large, and has honed and studied to prepare for this for the past thirty years. I don't know him at all, but nothing about him screams context awareness. It is also irrelevant to HRC - she lost because her communications were rooted in details and understanding, and people want the sound bite and bravado. On DT there is another item - he is willing to lie outright, including using suppliers are free creditors against their will. Perhaps that is good business, but fraud is usually illegal and it is interesting that his supporters find this a strength and not abject failure. \n\nMost importantly, the focus in this thread is attacking HRC and not addressing the original item - who in history was more qualified for the position?\n\nOther nits\n\nHRC never tried blame Trump on the Iraq war. She did, correctly, point out that he also supported it and was lying when he said he hadn't. There is also an oversimplification error - many voted for the war in the context of the moment; people failing to understand wanted blood, and many voted for it as political safety supported by W's comments that he was using it as leverage and wouldn't engage if there were other options (that he wanted to avenge daddy according to Clark should make any republican question). Any anger about the war and the outcome needs to remember that detail of history, in addition to the CIA's involvement in placing SH and the Shah. There is also an overreach in focusing on HRC - as a senator she was one of 100, and as SoS she was the messenger and recommended of the administration. Decisions to arm are almost always wrong (F&F), but sometimes the wrong decision is the lesser of evils. Not arguing this here; rather, blaming HRC and not others who did the same or worse and were directly responsible is a function of marketing and not geopolitics. Would you attack Reagan for Iran-Contra with the same vigor? W for the Iraq war order and removal agreement?\n\nHRC spent much of her life trying to make things better. The presidency didn't enter into her view until later in life (1990s) and she and Bill created CGI to be consistent with that goal. They partnered with other 'populist challenged' people like Bill/Melinda Gates to move the ball downfield. When her interest in politics hit she went in with gusto and won - never simply to hold the chair or use it for advancement. (If you disagree suggest you explore other sources; focus on her early pro bono and charity work along with bills for children and poor) (And before advancing the claim that CGI was a front for payola - it wasn't and you'd have to acknowledge Trump's charity as fraud)\n\nHillary will never be on the ash heap of history, and it is tragic that some cannot appreciate that no one, including Trump, is the anti-christ as the characters had been painted by polarization. You are correct that people are becoming more populist - not because of HRC's empathy and humility, of which she has plenty - but because they want simple answers to complex problems and someone else to answer their needs while blaming others for their lot in life. When someone in the midwest, where I spent much of my childhood, lost their job in the plant they froze and were open to blaming a Mexican illegal. Kids like me left and thrived, realizing that putting down others doesn't change anything for me. \n\nIt is very likely you will disagree. While politicians need to placate voters to be elected it is also true that the current congress and executive promised things they can never deliver on. It is doubtful they will be punished for this - *Idiocracy* shouldn't become a documentary, but, sadly, an ill-informed electorate that is more interested in Kim Kardashian's ass, sports and beer than knowing the role of the DOE or EPA isn't interested in much. They will complain and blame, and attack others as being *damn elitists'. I don't know how people will change, and honestly don't think they will collectively when there is more and more blame of others and a desire to control (women, blacks, hispanics, gays...).\n\nDon't expect a response - it would be preferred not to receive one for some time to allow time to research and consider. The knee jerk will likely be more Internet laughter and Bill Hicks/Alex Jones soundbites. You are likely smarter than this if you consider the available data and their sources.",1490333132,t1_dfc0axp,/r/Green/comments/60va72/king_the_democratic_party_seems_to_have_no/dfc9725/

df9iv5t,60u3hc,"I have never heard of the store before, so I can't comment about anything specific. \n\nBut in general here are the steps you would take;\n\n1) identify what ""sustainability"" means to the store. It sounds silly, but words like ""organic"" etc. means very different things to different people. Do you want it to well defined and front and centered, like Whole Foods? Or do you want it to be more subtle and ""just work"" in the background (IKEA and Walmart are good examples).\n\n2) start collecting data on whatever you decide to go with in #1. The more comprehensive you are the better, but obviously you have to be realistic about your goals. If you're trying the Walmart approach, then measuring energy usage, water consumption, etc. are the big targets. If you're trying to be like Whole Foods, then those metrics are going to be a little more secondary to the consumer's experience, expectations of products you carry, and how much information you provide about the product. \n\nWhole Foods stake their brand on the quality of the food and products, so things like providing cruelty-free vegetables is important both to the brand and their customers. Sustainability is just one way to connect with their customers. \n\nWalmart is a very large company, so they've turned to sustainability as a method of cutting cost and being more efficient. This is why you'll see many daylight windows on the ceiling of their warehouse stores - it is far cheaper to use natural lighting during the daytime than it is to artificially light it continuously. At the scale that Walmart operates at, this could easily be worth millions of dollars in electricity. \n\nIKEA does a bit of both. You'll notice that they have daylights just like Walmart and many similar tools, but they also occasionally provide information about their products. Almost all of their wooden furnitures, for example, are made from sustainably managed forests in Northern Europe. IKEA is a big company, but they also know their customers - mostly college students and other young people looking for an affordable choice on furnishing their new home. These people could easily go to Walmart and buy and equally low price item.   IKEA markets to this demographic by reinforcing a message that their products are ""an especially good value for its price."" Sustainability works both on the front end and the back end of the business. \n\nStep #1 is the starting point, but the data collected in #2 should lead to a reassessment of #1. Ideally the two steps should be repeated over and over again. If the company is really dedicated to sustainability and improving itself in other areas, then it should add a Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) to its executive level. The CSO would be wholly responsible for this research and report directly to the Board and President.

devgjh0,5z15ti,"Part of the silliness of the CAFE standards is the ""footprint"".     The size of the car makes a difference in the standards.   It has made cars bigger than ever as a bigger car is held to a lower standard.   This I believe has hurt the end goal of using less fuel by encouraging bigger cars.  If I were king of the world I'd remove the size standard.  The US would soon start to see things like Kei cars and city cars getting 50mpg+  \n\nAlso, according to wikipedia  ""Currently, the CAFE penalty is $55 USD per vehicle for every 1 mpg under the standard.""   Marking up a $25k car 250 is only 1% of it's cost while getting 14% less mileage.  \n\nI think it was hopeful that pickups in particular were starting to be held to a higher standard, and as such the newer pickups are coming with smaller engines and getting better mileage.   Like so many other things, I expect my hopes to soon be dashed for the next 4 years.   On the other hand, with big oil more in charge, gas prices will soon rise for more oil company profits, and people will start to choose more efficient cars.   \n\nHigher gas prices, coupled with the recent advances in batteries, means that the next profit grab by a recently unchecked oil industry might popularize electric cars.    Add self driving and the younger generation's view of a car as an appliance along with their economic disenfranchisement  and CAFE standards will hopefully become increasingly moot as electric cars take over. \n",1489420632,t3_5z15ti,/r/Green/comments/5z15ti/why_has_car_fuel_economy_lagging_way_behind_cafe/devgjh0/

dfwckjb,5ygsk9,"The whole thing is bonkers. A more detailed briefing on exactly what the change is: http://www.solar-trade.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Stakeholder-briefing-business-rates-rooftop-solar-v0.8.pdf\n\nThe UK does not have property tax per se, it has ""business rates"" which are collected by the local authority. State schools are considered to be ""businesses"" (WTF#1), while private schools which are nearly always structured as ""charities"" do not have to pay rates (WTF#2).\n\nBusiness rates are calculated based on the value of the building + fixed equipment (plant). This change counts solar panels producing energy used predominantly on the premises as ""plant"" and imposes a requirement to pay tax based on their capital value. (WTF#3). This does not apply to sites generating primarily for export (WTF#4).\n\nIt's unnecessarily penalising schools who bought panels in the hope that they could use the future guaranteed subsidies as income. But that's about what you'd expect from a Conservative government.\n\n(Definition of ""plant"": http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/540/pdfs/uksi_20000540_en.pdf )\n\n(The whole thing brings up an unforseen disadvantage of trying to do renewables through a ""distorted free market"" rather than just direct state action: people taking advantage of the subsidies are called ""gaming the system"", when the entire point of the subsidy policy was to pay them to do exactly that. Also, UK local government and schools funding is a collection of fudges to outdated systems, but nobody wants to go near that mess.)",1491457042,t3_5ygsk9,/r/Green/comments/5ygsk9/solarpowered_uk_schools_face_an_800_percent_tax/dfwckjb/
des1zm7,5ygsk9,"It would be important to note (and the article, i think purposefully, doesn't make this clear) whether this is a removal of a tax deduction or in fact a new tax. My guess is that it's the former. Which means the government isn't taxing you for ""harnessing the sun"", but rather, no longer paying you to do so.\n\nAlso, ""800% ""is *so sensationalized* when their former tax was $100 per year for the entire school (like, one day of one teacher's salary?). \n\nI don't think there's anything wrong with removing a tax benefit, *just because it applies to a public school.* If you want better funding to your schools, then change the budget, don't fight to keep this random tax credit that may or may not be relevant anymore. \n\nFinally, I think we need to realize that there is some cost associated with solar panels on the national scale that is, mostly, absorbed by the power companies.  Especially in some of the smaller European countries, I believe they've begun to saturate the energy supply. The problem is that while a small amount of solar on the grid one-for-one offsets fossil fuel production, when it makes up 25+% of the grid, you end up with overproduction mid-day and then under production at night and very large transients even during the day. This means that, to run efficienly, the grid needs more storage, more peaking generators (that are *significantly* more expensive and less efficient.) and more complex control systems. All that means that the energy company has to spend a lot to provide consistent power to your home or school, even if it generates 80% of its own power. \n\nI still think we should probably be subsidizing solar in some places (e.g. the continental U.S. ) but there are places where it's starting to not make sense anymore, until we figure out some solid solutions to prepare the grid for them. So.,. start subsidizing energy storage and research...",1489195886,t1_deqm6vh,/r/Green/comments/5ygsk9/solarpowered_uk_schools_face_an_800_percent_tax/des1zm7/

ddm2avx,5ta004,"(Note: I consider nuclear mostly green, but I know a lot of people don't, so Ive made a distinction here.)\n\nThis is my very pragmatic view on the matter. Replace coal and oil and gas as quickly as possible with green energy, with nuclear as a backup for now. Taking the heavy polluters offline right now will save the planet immediately, but cripple our current way of life. For the next few decades, slowly (read: as quickly as economically possible) replace heavy polluters with nuclear and green energy where convenient. The main thing here is to get coal offline, and nuclear is the best middle ground right now. Comparedly very low carbon emission is much better than massive carbon emmission.\n\nThis is where we can economically catch our breath for a while. Nuclear is a good stepping stone to 100% green. While it's not without fault, its all we've got for the really near future. And its safer and cleaner than coal (nuclear power even puts out less radioactivity into the local environment than coal, let me know if anyone needs sources).\n\nAfter several decades, green power will be more convenient, cheaper, and more expansive. Slowly convert from spending on nuclear and green to fully green. At this point, we should start shutting down older nuclear plants in favor of the newer ones. Finally, at the end of the somewhat-near-future stage, we should be at mostly green energy production, with newer nuclear stations left for backup supply.\n\nFar future: 100% green production, with no nuclear (or limited nuclear) backup. Energy storage is always toted as a huge problem at this stage, but I don't doubt humans will find a way to store energy in higher and higher quantities. Also, this doesnt take into account future sources of green energy which may be produced, like nuclear fusion.\n\nTldr: start nuclear, build green, keep some nuclear as backup, eventually completely replace",1486822037,t3_5ta004,/r/Green/comments/5ta004/to_what_extent_do_we_stop_using_oil_coal_etc/ddm2avx/
ddme614,5ta004,"I think, economically, it makes sense to be pushing hard on renewables now. There are significant areas of wind development, solar and others that are ""economically viable"" and by that I mean we literally save money over fossil fuels by creating them. We should be expanding policy in support of them and making the decision to utilize those sources before turning to increased fossil fuel production. Obviously we aren't going to shut down plants and shut off people's lights. This is going to be a market solution, and all we can do is make economic decisions and incentives (like a carbon tax) to speed up the development of sustainable energy.\n\nBiofuels will be of growing importance. The new generation of biofuels that are currently becoming economically relevant are mostly carbon neutral and have the potential to replace a large fraction of our gasoline/diesel/aviation/natural gas fuels. \n\nI'd love to see nuclear, but honestly, the fact that there are zero plans for new reactors now, means that we won't see any new reactors for a decade or more. They're a mid-term solution, but I do support it.\n\nThere isn't one ideal path for this. Any option that saves money and carbon emissions is a good one. There is a lot of work to be done on both technological and policy side. We need to continue pouring funding into research, while also supporting policy which makes the technology more available. As a student or scientist, choosing to focus on research areas of relevance is important. As the general public, we should be supportive of government policy to fund research and programs to enable access to renewable energy (like financing programs).\n\nPersonally I think one of the most important things as a consumer and a part of the society is to stay informed about technologies and current policy. There are plenty of ways to support the implementation of sustainable, economically viable energy sources right now and make informed decisions.",1486840327,t3_5ta004,/r/Green/comments/5ta004/to_what_extent_do_we_stop_using_oil_coal_etc/ddme614/

It all comes down to economics - if it's too expensive to get anywhere else, someone will mine it from the landfill.

dcln7o0,5oqliz,"The video is crap -- pure garbage. Read below for the full explanation. First, the guy is conflating fracking/natural gas, and gasoline/petroleum products. Hydro-fracking and pressurizing oil wells have been around for quite a while.\n\nThe far, *FAR* bigger reason for the $2 a gallon gasoline that he seems so enamored with is geo-politics -- specifically, the renewed US Cold War against Russia. (I'll ignore the role of the petro-dollar, US taxes, subsidies and other factors in our cheap US gasoline.)\n\nAfter the Russians objected to the US/NATO overthrowing the elected Ukrainian government in 2014, the US pulled the stops out to renew our aggression against Russia.\n\nA key part of that plan was to torpedo the Russian government's money line of exporting oil. So the US got our Saudi vassals to pump oil like there was no tomorrow. The Saudi dictatorship agreed to this for a number of reasons, but one big reason being that it would sink the then-surging US production of shale/tar sands petroleum.\n\nShale oil/tar sands petroleum is heavily polluting and very expensive to produce and refine. Therefore, it needs a high price per barrel of oil to be economically viable. The Saudis, not being idiots, knew that if they could drop the price of oil then the shale oil/tar sands petroleum would take a huge hit and some of those companies would go bankrupt (that's currently happening).\n\nThe other big reason that is coming into play is the increasing Saudi realization that they'll *never* be able to pump all of their oil out of the ground and sell it -- global warming will demand that much of it remain in the ground never to be pumped out.\n\nSo the Saudis figure if someone is going to make money today pumping out oil, it might as well be them -- so the Saudis make money and please the US at the same time, a win-win situation. And the Saudis are likely using their participation in the US scheme to punish Russia to horse-trade with the US on other issues (e.g. Syria).\n\nThis whole strategy of lowering world oil prices to hurt Russia *is* working. The Russian economy initially took a large hit(recession), but today it seems to have stabilized and is bouncing back slightly.\n\nAll in all, I'd say the short video is the ""reality TV"" version of an explanation: stupidly simple and overall wrong.\n\nEdit: Typos.",1484774956,t3_5oqliz,/r/Green/comments/5oqliz/why_gas_is_so_cheap_and_why_thats_going_to_be_a/dcln7o0/

dbqsjzr,5kq8bm,"This is an interesting area of research right now in the sustainable business field. Many of the more dominant theories from CSR describe something similar to what you have mentioned, that a win-win solution can be developed and scaled. While critics argue that these scenarios are superficial, short-lived, or pass sustainability-related impacts to other organisations/regions. \n\nConcerning the question of **'to what extent should corporations invest in sustainability?'** is largely normative. From a business perspective, theoretically, they should do what yields the highest return for their shareholders. This could mean developing new products and services, industries, or risk management. From a more social contract theory, corporations should be accountable for all of their detrimental impacts towards society. These are just two views on the normative aspect of this field. There are others. \n\n**On to the areas you mentioned you to want to address.** It is evident that there is a push from consumers, governments, NGOs and even competitors, for enhanced good business practices. This introduces two large areas of uncertainty in the literature, which both have their theoretical and empirical challenges. First, much of the literature has focused towards large, publicly traded companies in the west. There are many research gaps in terms of small and medium sized enterprises. These could become a large leverage considering there are so many of them. Conversely, large corporations are much more visible and also have large impacts of their own. Second, ""good"" practice is difficult to determine. This largely stems the increasingly complexity in the definition of corporate sustainability. Previously, corporations generally had to focus on their local community, the government, suppliers, and some NGOs. Now many thinkers argue that corporate sustainability needs to consider all of these stakeholders, but also future stakeholders. Also, they need to consider their impacts towards the integration of the economy, environment and society. Integrating all three of these ""pillars"" is what is a challenge right now. There are some clear ""better"" practices, like reducing waste or energy-use. But the way that sustainability-based accounting is currently being used by corporations, it is difficult to determine what the ""total"" or ""net"" sustainability impact of a corporation is being negative impacts are either not reported or are not understandable for comparison. \n\nThere are many assumptions in the above, but it can get very complex without setting some boundaries. There are many questions in the literature that continue to deserve attention. I would **recommend** finding 4-6 literature reviews on the current state or state-of-the-art in the field(s) that you're interested in, and trying to find your dissertation topic that way. This is a good way of getting broad strokes of the literature quickly. Also, a lot of the business literature seems to focus on the positive aspects of corporate sustainability. Another field that sheds some interesting critiques is sustainability science. Although it can be difficult to navigate through the literature because of its multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary topics. \n\nLet me know if you have other questions. \n\nNote: Finished masters in sustainability management, working on PhD in Corporate Sustainability and Sustainability-based accounting\n",1482984991,t3_5kq8bm,/r/Green/comments/5kq8bm/looking_for_some_dissertation_adviceinformation/dbqsjzr/

I'd suggest redoing the survey so that each category is at least rated independently of each other (rather than ranked).

db4th5i,5hz41i,"Worked fine on my phone \n\nThis is what it says:\n\nSenate Quietly Passes The ""Countering Disinformation And Propaganda Act""\n\nTyler Durden's picture\nby Tyler Durden\nDec 12, 2016 1:13 AM\n15.2K\nSHARES\nTwitterFacebookReddit\nWhile we wait to see if and when the Senate will pass (and president will sign) Bill  ""H.R. 6393, Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017"", which was passed by the House at the end of November with an overwhelming majority and which seeks to crack down on websites suspected of conducting Russian propaganda and calling for the US government to ""counter active measures by Russia to exert covert influence … carried out in  coordination with, or at the behest of, political leaders or the security services of the Russian Federation and the role of the Russian Federation has been hidden or not acknowledged publicly,” another, perhaps even more dangerous and limiting to civil rights and freedom of speech bill passed on December 8.\n\nRecall that as we reported in early June, ""a bill to implement the U.S.’ very own de facto Ministry of Truth has been quietly introduced in Congress. As with any legislation attempting to dodge the public spotlight the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act of 2016 marks a further curtailment of press freedom and another avenue to stultify avenues of accurate information. Introduced by Congressmen Adam Kinzinger and Ted Lieu, H.R. 5181 seeks a “whole-government approach without the bureaucratic restrictions” to counter “foreign disinformation and manipulation,” which they believe threaten the world’s “security and stability.”\n\nADVERTISING\n\n\nAlso called the Countering Information Warfare Act of 2016 (S. 2692), when introduced in March by Sen. Rob Portman, the legislation represents a dramatic return to Cold War-era government propaganda battles. “These countries spend vast sums of money on advanced broadcast and digital media capabilities, targeted campaigns, funding of foreign political movements, and other efforts to influence key audiences and populations,” Portman explained, adding that while the U.S. spends a relatively small amount on its Voice of America, the Kremlin provides enormous funding for its news organization, RT.“Surprisingly,”\n\nPortman continued, “there is currently no single U.S. governmental agency or department charged with the national level development, integration and synchronization of whole-of-government strategies to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation.”  \n\n\n\nLong before the ""fake news"" meme became a daily topic of extensive conversation on wuch mainstream fake news portals as CNN and WaPo, H.R. 5181 would rask the Secretary of State with coordinating the Secretary of Defense, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Broadcasting Board of Governors to “establish a Center for Information Analysis and Response,” which will pinpoint sources of disinformation, analyze data, and — in true dystopic manner — ‘develop and disseminate’ “fact-based narratives” to counter effrontery propaganda.\n\n\n* * *\n\nFast forward to this past Thursday, December 8, when the ""Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act"" passed in the Senate, quietly inserted inside the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Conference Report.\n\nHere is the full statement issued by the generously funded Senator Rob Portman (R- Ohio) on the passage of a bill that further chips away at press liberties in the US, and which sets the stage for future which hunts and website shutdowns, purely as a result of an accusation that any one media outlet or site is considered as a source of ""disinformation and propaganda"" and is shut down by the government.\n\nSenate Passes Major Portman-Murphy Counter-Propaganda Bill as Part of NDAA\n\nPortman/Murphy Bill Promotes Coordinated Strategy to Defend America, Allies Against Propaganda and Disinformation from Russia, China & Others\n\nU.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) today announced that their Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act – legislation designed to help American allies counter foreign government propaganda from Russia, China, and other nations – has passed the Senate as part of the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Conference Report. The bipartisan bill, which was introduced by Senators Portman and Murphy in March, will improve the ability of the United States to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation by establishing an interagency center housed at the State Department to coordinate and synchronize counter-propaganda efforts throughout the U.S. government. To support these efforts, the bill also creates a grant program for NGOs, think tanks, civil society and other experts outside government who are engaged in counter-propaganda related work. This will better leverage existing expertise and empower local communities to defend themselves from foreign manipulation.\n\n“The passage of this bill in the Senate today takes us one critical step closer to effectively confronting the extensive, and destabilizing, foreign propaganda and disinformation operations being waged against us. While the propaganda and disinformation threat has grown, the U.S. government has been asleep at the wheel. Today we are finally signaling that enough is enough; the United States will no longer sit on the sidelines. We are going to confront this threat head-on,” said Senator Portman. “With the help of this bipartisan bill, the disinformation and propaganda used against our allies and our interests will fail.”\n\n\n“Congress has taken a big step in fighting back against fake news and propaganda from countries like Russia. When the president signs this bill into law, the United States will finally have a dedicated set of tools and resources to confront our adversaries’ widespread efforts to spread false narratives that undermine democratic institutions and compromise America’s foreign policy goals,” said Murphy. “I’m proud of what Senator Portman and I accomplished here because it’s long past time for the U.S. to get off the sidelines and confront these growing threats.”\n\nNOTE: The bipartisan Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act is organized around two main priorities to help achieve the goal of combatting the constantly evolving threat of foreign disinformation. They are as follows:\n\nThe first priority is developing a whole-of-government strategy for countering foreign propaganda and disinformation. The bill would increase the authority, resources, and mandate of the Global Engagement Center to include state actors like Russia and China in addition to violent extremists. The Center will be led by the State Department, but with the active senior level participation of the Department of Defense, USAID, the Broadcasting Board of Governors, the Intelligence Community, and other relevant agencies. The Center will develop, integrate, and synchronize whole-of-government initiatives to expose and counter foreign disinformation operations and proactively advance fact-based narratives that support U.S. allies and interests.\nSecond, the legislation seeks to leverage expertise from outside government to create more adaptive and responsive U.S. strategy options. The legislation establishes a fund to help train local journalists and provide grants and contracts to NGOs, civil society organizations, think tanks, private sector companies, media organizations, and other experts outside the U.S. government with experience in identifying and analyzing the latest trends in foreign government disinformation techniques. This fund will complement and support the Center’s role by integrating capabilities and expertise available outside the U.S. government into the strategy-making process. It will also empower a decentralized network of private sector experts and integrate their expertise into the strategy-making process.\n* * *\n\n\nIn other words, the Act will i) greenlight the government to crack down with impunity against any media property it deems ""propaganda"", and ii) provide substantial amounts of money fund an army of ""local journalist"" counterpropaganda, to make sure the government's own fake news drowns that of the still free ""fringes.""\n\nSo while packaged politely in a veneer of ""countering disinformation and propaganda"", the bill, once signed by Obama, will effectively give the government a full mandate to punish, shut down or otherwise prosecute, any website it deems offensive and a source of ""foreign government propaganda from Russia, China or other nations."" And since there is no formal way of proving whether or not there is indeed a foreign propaganda sponsor, all that will be sufficient to eliminate any ""dissenting"" website, will be the government's word against that of the website. One can be confident that the US government will almost certainly prevail in every single time.\n\n \n\n ",1481613153,t1_db4recs,/r/Green/comments/5hz41i/goodbye_reddit_voat_wordpress_wikileaks_4chan_and/db4th5i/

I went to my local Green caucus once a couple years ago, and got to meet the local Green candidates so I recognize them when they run for various offices partisan and non-partisan.

davlsiq,5gt121,"**Full Text**.  \n   \n   \n**Al Gore Says Meeting With Donald Trump on Climate Change Was ‘Productive**.  \nBy Michael C. Bender. \n*Updated Dec. 5, 2016 10:38 a.m. ET*.   \n     \n     \n\nOne month after saying that Donald Trump “would take us toward a climate catastrophe,” former Vice President Al Gore met with the newly elected Republican on Monday in New York as he tries to extend an olive branch on his top issue.\n\nMr. Gore met with Mr. Trump and his daughter, Ivanka Trump, who is reportedly interested in pursuing climate-change issues.\n\n“I had a lengthy and very productive session with the president-elect. It was a sincere search for areas of common ground,” Mr. Gore told reporters at Trump Tower. “I had a meeting beforehand with Ivanka Trump. The bulk of the time was with the president-elect, Donald Trump. I found it an extremely interesting conversation, and to be continued, and I’m just going to leave it at that.”\n\nDuring the campaign, Mr. Gore criticized Mr. Trump’s stated positions on climate change, including an October campaign stop in Miami for then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in which he said electing Mr. Trump would lead to a “climate catastrophe.”\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly called climate change a “hoax.” In 2012, he posted on Twitter that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.”\n\n“Climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax—a lot of people are making a lot of money,” Mr. Trump said on Meet the Press in January. “I know much about climate change. I’ve received environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change.”\n\nAfter the election, Reince Priebus, chief of staff to Mr. Trump, said on Fox News that the president-elect’s “default” position is that he thinks “most of it is a bunch of bunk.”\n\nStill. Mr. Gore has said that he hopes Mr. Trump won’t undo President Barack Obama’s ambitious climate agenda. “President-elect Trump said he wanted to be a president for all Americans,” Mr. Gore wrote after the election on the website of the Climate Reality Project, the advocacy group he founded. “In that spirit, I hope that he will work with the overwhelming majority of us who believe that the climate crisis is the greatest threat we face as a nation.”",1481069341,t3_5gt121,/r/Green/comments/5gt121/al_gore_says_meeting_with_donald_trump_on_climate/davlsiq/

I kept all the things you listed 'in mind' when I made my comment - and I didn't have to bandy-about my (considerable) resume in this field as I did it...  ;o)  J\n\nI'm sure we agree on more than 90% of the content here, so I'll make a few comments clarifying my statement and then note the subject where, perhaps, we differ. \n\nObviously, we both agree that this is 'good' marketing, but I don't see where I said that Adidas' entire business model is a ploy.  Therefore, analogizing what I did say into saying Patagonia's business model is all marketing doesn't make sense.  I wouldn't/didn't say that either of these business's environmental efforts should be disregarded as marketing ploys - I said that this particular product was no better than a ploy.  This comes up again in your second para, and to be clear: I didn't say (and don't think) that it's ALL a ploy.  Further, I didn't purposefully imbue my statement with 'an attitude of wrong-doing', and I'll happily apologize if it left that impression - provided that gets us to the same page.  \n\nJust a comment: that's a very noble, perhaps academic(?), definition of marketing.  I should hope that's how it plays out everywhere in the 'real world'!  \n\nWhere we might differ is that, despite all of the good work I hear you saying Adidas is doing for the environment, I'm making the claim that this particular project IS NOT an example of that good work.  Sneaker tops that dissolve with a special enzyme has practically nothing to do with the environmental problems we face, and my recommendation to Adidas (if they're serious about dampening their impact) is to focus their resources on more pressing issues.  I applaud any good work they are doing on the industry issues I mentioned and any that I ommitted.  However, if other companies see that Adidas is doing well by making dissolving sneaker tops, and are encouraged to follow their lead (as you suggested), they'll be following Adidas away from the most important things they could/should be doing.  That's not the kind of leadership we need from a brand like Adidas.  \n\nI simply don't know all the facets of their business, and I hope that Adidas is doing the great work you imply.  We could probably agree, however, that Adidas can be a more effective agent for environmental ethics if they drop all smokescreens and instead of issuing press releases, spending money and time on this project - they focus on the greatest impacts of their global supply and manufacturing chain.  \n\nI appreciate your view - and I doubt we really differ; my guess is that we're just clarifying our notes to eachother.

So it does actually have in impact if it is able to be scaled up to their current production level. However, we should always be weary of the knock-on effects. What does it take in terms of energy and resources to make these uppers? What effect would the enzyme and material infused water have on aquatic life? \n\nI stand behind it mostly because the act of innovation (because of the need to achieve business goals; i.e. profits, market share) is creating something new and potentially better than the status quo. And to get academic again... you can force people to buy products and lying to them would damage the brand so much that it wouldn't be worth it. Therefore the best businesses can do is create products that they feel customers have a need or want for, Adidas would not have created this unless society (their customers) wanted something environmentally friendly.\n\nAnd I likewise appreciate your view and this discussion as well.

dals69e,5fmx2v,"This is real- the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (or ""Reggie"") is a coalition formed in 2005 of 8 States on the east coast including Mass and NY aimed at curbing GHG emissions from the power sector. The program works similarly to California's Cap and Trade program (which was modeled off of Reggie and the European ETS), with a declining emission budget or ""cap,"" an allowance market, and auctions from which proceeds are invested in further GHG reduction programs. \n\nThe program's success is debatable, but it definitely underscores the ability for states to form regional partnerships in order to tackle what are clearly regional issues. California's program is now linked with Quebec, so even national borders can be crossed. \n\nIt's hard to predict anything anymore, but if the Trump administration does come down hard on federal environmental regs we could see more interest in forming regional collaborations, especially coming from costal states. It would be really interesting to see if the Trump administration would try to weaken or block these efforts. \n\nThat would be new constitutional territory and almost certainly go to SCOTUS.

States can recognize a standard and determine if it meets or exceeds their own guidance and say: ""hey, that's cool here to"" and officially acknowledge the other states paperwork is acceptable without amendment in their state. \nIn regards to market forces, piling on between states is also a thing and is often referenced as the reason that Texas has such a dominate say in text books. (Reference to be provided by google)\n\nThere is also an organization for city mayors that crosses states, but I really don't know much about it. \n\nMaking the recommendation to a series of governors to form a coalition requires that California lead. With California, and the 9 other most strongly democratic states (?maybe, this is from memory and in no particular order) New York, Maryland, Illinois, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, <Hawaii / Washington?> I think that's about 28% of the population. But without California, that market shrinks.\n\nLong term however, nothing says climate change should be a partisan issue, so focusing on coastal states may be an alternative approach to get North Carolina and Florida involved - maybe some of the Gulf states if it's a isolated issue.

Issue a joint memorandum of understanding, and form a non profit corporation that provides technical and administrative support for the program and the auctions. \n\nNow I just need to dig into the individual state laws that were signed to make the joint understanding happen.

da98yo5,5dqrv5,"Organic is the only term that's regulated. Natural isn't. GMO and Monsanto don't mix you have to keep that in mind. I understand that humans have screwed up the planet so much that we will need some degree of GMO to keep up with demand. However Exxon Mobil which is owned by Rockefeller and the usual cast of criminals knew that our planet is going to transition to a new climate 40 years ago. What did they do? Nothing but suppress the future for decades until the wheels fell off. \n\nBack to my point about GMO despite what big media would have you believe the state of GMO industry is corrupt as hell. The GMO are being made with built in insecticide that kills both good and bad insects indiscriminately. This is also contributing to the genocide of bees around the world. This insecticide is so potent that even washing it off doesn't work and you risk getting poisoned yourself. Not to mention the drought resistant GMO being developed require even more pesticides to protect them from bugs than even traditional, corporate controlled farms! One of the other dangerous aspects about GMO is the ability for multinational corporations to patent the seeds and thus put a stranglehold on the food supplies of other countries! Exactly how Henry Kissinger planned it. If your president for example decides to not go along with granting certain favors to Monsanto or another similar GMO company than his/her people will starve because most of the food supply is either owned by their seed patents or the environment is so screwed up that the people are highly dependent on GMO to survive. GMO also can potentially disrupt ecosystems if they are not properly inoculated. Corporate conglomerates should not be allowed to patent entire food supplies, nor should they have absolute control over the production of the food. Every citizen in a free society ought to and is entitled to grow their own food. Every citizen should be able to access and grow their own GMO as well so long as they are properly labelled and raised separately from the tried and true organic.

It may still here, but I'll try to manage it. 😀\n\nThat said there are some dilemmas with the suggested approach\n\n1) A close contest on popular vote will encourage less bat-shit crazy candidates to follow in Trump's footsteps. The US needs to clearly say that Trump is not ok, and that climate change denial is a showstopper for a Green. \n\n2) One vote swapped isn't the game. The message of the next 72 hours is every vote. As I started, it would be unfortunate to vote third party in a 'safe' state (point 1), but understandable. It isn't appropriate for a close state, and many are. Look at the mess in the U.K. for a fresh reminder. \n\n3) Plugging one's nose is politics, and it has been forever. It is about compromise. And when a party aligns behind a ACC denying, sexist, xenophobic, lying, ignorant dictator there is something wrong with that party. They want to win for the win and threaten to sabotage their paid for jobs to uphold the Constitution and run the country. The democrats are too nice to successfully call all the bullshit - hell, BO just supported a Trump disruptor at his rally (and then Trump lied about it). Flip the roles and see if you can imagine the same. \n\n4) Lastly, I respectfully disagree with the position that the vote-trade is practical. In addition to reason one there are simple guarantees of follow through and, most of all, a need for third parties to obtain votes and power at *times when they can use it*. This year we blew it. An alliance with Bernie and the libertarians would have brought the democrats to power in all three branches with a collation that would have advanced green causes *immediately*. Instead the greens hunkered down to be stubborn dust mites on the US political stage and lost. And anything that strengthens the GOP at this point diminishes any chance at less corruption, climate change mitigation and transparency in corporate America.\n\nIt is your vote, and many, including me, share the frustration. The problem is that a winner take all plan like OWS or third parties this week leads to a loss. And a devastating one. Most of the corruption and benefits to corporations and the rich come from republican legislation.

This is unrealistic.\n2. Rooftop solar cannot turn to face the sun (or if they can, they can only turn slightly), this dramatically reduces their efficiency.\n3. Material costs and installation costs are going to be insane.  Assuming that we give solar power all of the advantages, producing 24/7 at their rated capacity (which cannot happen because half the time it's night, most of the time the panel is facing the wrong way, etc), it would require 34.11 million acres of area to fully replace coal on the grid (using US 2012 estimated power consumption numbers). This is a crazy amount of area. Roughly 40% of the land area of Germany.  How expensive do you think 34.11 million acres of solar panels are?  (On the other hand, utility scale solar is much cheaper and more efficient, but the land numbers given are actually for utility scale, rooftop requires even more area.)\n\nDecentralization of power is a mixed bag.

d8g0a53,55w9my,"I'm with you there, although I can really only speak for Kindles, as that's what I use.  I've heard that we don't actually permanently own the ebooks that we purchase - only a certain number of downloads of them.  So, theoretically, you could pay nearly full price for a book that only you can read and, over time if you end up having/needing new devices, run out of access to it.  I haven't followed up on that though, so I don't know the most accurate details.  However, if you have a partner or a friend you really trust (i.e., with your credit card & account info, etc.), you can share Kindle books with each other via an Amazon household account, but only certain (and very few) publishers will allow you to temporarily loan your ebooks to others outside of your ""household""...and even then it's only for about 2 weeks and with other stipulations.  If you have your own PDF version of the book though, it can be emailed directly to a friend's Kindle for download.  I've proofread a few of my friends' manuscripts that way.  Most public libraries in the U.S., UK, NZ & Germany (as far as I know - likely many others too) offer free ebook loans if you have a library card with them...so your options and others' options are relatively endless.  You have the potential to lose out on instant gratification if the book is already checked out and you have to place a digital hold on it, but patience is a virtue, right?",1475724930,t1_d8f48sc,/r/Green/comments/55w9my/are_ereaders_ecofriendlier_than_traditional_books/d8g0a53/

Unlike in a top-down decision making structure, in a grassroots/participatory structure, all of the different individuals and communities could use their ability to participate in decision making to really help ensure that the only policies that are made are policies that are shown to benefit (or at least ""not harm"") the environments that they are a part of (so this means that, for example, there might be lower chance of pro-war policies being approved at the grassroots level not only because of the loss of life that war can lead to, but also because of the effects it can have on the environments that different individuals and communities live in).\n\nElites in a top-down structure wouldn't (especially in the short term) necessarily have to worry about other environmental regions but their own.",1475533777,t1_d8cq8fo,/r/Green/comments/55pqfb/why_is_grassroots_organization_essential_for/d8cr3xm/

d8bb7a3,55kfbe,"The Parallel Periscope Debate by Jill Stein of the Green Party was a raving success. Counting Twitter, Facebook, Russia Today America, Instagram, Tumblr, Facebook, Democracy Now and Periscope combined came out to 15 million interested voters! Jill needs 43 million or more to win the election outright! Those numbers from the parallel debate are STILL COUNTING! Trump and Clinton bases are both collapsing don't let the polls fool you. This is all being done by the internet alone who knows how much the other media initiatives are supplementing at this point. This month is crunch time which means GOTV month. Jill Stein has all the infrastructure she needs including Bernie Sanders level text banking system. All she needs now is more funding to make an election day blow out even more likely. If all 15 million who watched the parallel debate this week donated just $9 for Stein she would have $135 million dollars which is more than enough to get through Oct. If all 13 million who voted for Bernie also gave $9 for Stein she would have an extra $117 million dollars which she can use to gave to down ballot Green Candidates like Arnold Menconi CO US Senate, Robin Wilson NY US Senate, Dr. Margaret Flowers MD US Senate, and more state and local races in about half the US. If Jill Stein can use all the help in the Senate as she can especially if you want to confirm an awesome Supreme Court Justice that so many people are so damn worried about. Don't forget 20 states will be voting on legalizing marijuana, anti bribery legislation, climate change legislation like FL and CA just recently passed. There's so much to vote for then just candidates this fall. If you can't donate $9 it's ok don't beat yourself up. The next best thing we can do is find 9 people who want to give $9 or more to the Stein/Baraka Campaign. We all do what we can. Every small bit makes a bigger impact.

d7e2j9b,51msyp,"This article raises a significant issue. There are a couple things worth mentioning. \n\nThe first is that climate change threatens to destabilize the existing agricultural infrastructure. Some areas will receive additional, harder and more destructive rain and wind patterns while others will receive less rain, simply because as the atmosphere and oceans heat wind patterns will and have shifted. Heavier rain falls will do damage to sensitive crops like rice in areas where they're grown for subsistence. Think about the steppe rice paddy fields that make for such amazing photographs in asian communities. Torrential rain will wash them away for example. In the United States, for instance, two thirds of the country was experiencing drought conditions because of a tremendous heat wave in 2012. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/historic-drought-covers-nearly-two-thirds-of-continental-us/2012/07/19/gJQAOp6fvW_blog.html) This hit the mid west very hard, and if it continued, would have led to higher food prices. In a worst case scenario the carrying capacity of this agricultural hub would be decimated and it would lead to food shortages. \n\nSecondly cities are only going to continue to grow. Flight for rural areas to mega cities like Los Angeles and New York City has been increasing in recent years. [Today, the trend toward urbanisation continues: as of 2014, it’s thought that 54 per cent of the world’s population lives in cities – and it’s expected to reach 66 per cent by 2050. - http://www.citymetric.com/skylines/three-million-people-move-cities-every-week-so-how-can-cities-plan-migrants-1546] Given the increase we will need better infrastructure to feed the people who are moving. Already cities see some of the highest food prices. Most of the people who are moving are low income, looking for job opportunities in the cities. Many places where there is low income housing are also 'food islands' in that the people there do have ready access to supermarkets. \n\nSomething to consider though is that we already produce enough food in this world to feed the entire global population. We produce enough for 10 billion people (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-holt-gimenez/world-hunger_b_1463429.html). We need to consider where this food is going and how it is being used. Right now a large percentage of this crop is being used to feed animals in slaughter facilities, grown for their meat. \n\nAnother thing to consider is this vertical farm. It's an interesting concept. You essentially build a skyscraper that would grow crops aquaponically, as the article talks about, and use that food to feed the cities they are located in. There is already one being constructed in Newark, New Jersey. It is already entering the conversation for city planners, which is a big hurdle to overcome.

d70ekyz,501heq,"RAED KHADER, a Jordanian driver, has an alarming habit of thumbing his mobile phone while at the wheel—albeit on a straight road cutting across the desert. But after scrolling back through almost two years of photos, he finds a picture that tickles him: of camels against a sandy backdrop. Today that same spot outside Ma’an, a poverty-stricken city in south Jordan, is crawling with workers in the final stages of installing five square kilometres (almost two square miles) of solar panels.\n\nHe is enraptured by the photovoltaic (PV) modules that shimmer in the desert sunshine. “It’s amazing. I love it. It’s good to see my country develop its own source of energy,” he says. “We have such good sun here. It’s free. Why don’t we use more of it?” In his enthusiasm, he has convinced his daughter to become one of the first Jordanian women to study for a solar-energy engineering degree.\n\nIn this section\nFollow the sun\nThe pits\nMail’s got you\nScales dropped\nBaiting the bear\nKnitty gritty\nOpportunity strikes\nKeeping it under your hat\nReprints\nThe 160-megawatt (MW) solar park, which is scheduled to open this summer, will mark the launch of Jordan’s effort to reduce its fossil-fuel imports, which generated 96% of its energy last year and cost about 10% of GDP. In a restive neighbourhood, it has good reason to become more self-reliant. Its liking for solar intensified after Egypt temporarily cut natural-gas supplies during the Arab spring in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nThe small steps sanctioned by Jordan’s cautious bureaucracy pale in comparison with the growth of solar energy in some other countries. But they illustrate the allure of the technology, as well as some of its teething problems.\n\nAcross the developing world, solar power is hitting its stride. Rather than the rooftop panels popular in Germany, countries where solar irradiance is much stronger than northern Europe are creating vast parks with tens of thousands of flexible PV panels supplying power to their national grids. Some countries, such as China, provide generous subsidies (though these are sometimes years overdue). But in other countries solar PV is becoming competitive even without financial support.\n\nIn 2015 China surged past Germany to become the biggest producer of solar energy, benefiting from its dominance of solar-panel manufacturing and policies to reduce dependence on dirtier fuels, such as coal. Solar power accounts for just 3% of the electricity mix, but China is now building its biggest plant, in the Gobi desert. Analysts expect the country to install 12 gigawatts (GW) of solar in the first half of this year. That would be one-third more than the record amount America plans to build for the full year. Coal, meanwhile, is in growing trouble (see article).\n\nIndia is determined to keep up. Its government is targeting a 20-fold increase in solar-power capacity by 2022, to 100GW. Though this might be over-ambitious, KPMG, a consultancy, expects solar’s share of India’s energy mix to rise to 12.5% by 2025, from less than 1% today. It thinks solar in India will be cheaper than coal by 2020. (Even Coal India, a mostly state-owned entity, plans to contract 1GW of solar power to cut energy bills.) Such is the frenzy that officials in sunny Punjab are urging farmers to lease their land to solar developers rather than till it.\n\nLed by big projects in these two countries, global solar-energy capacity rose by 26% last year. More remarkable is the decline in its cost. Studies of the “levelised cost” of electricity, which estimate the net present value of the costs of a generating system divided by the expected output over its lifetime, show solar getting close to gas and coal as an attractively cheap source of power. Auctions of long-term contracts to purchase solar power in developing countries such as South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, Peru and Mexico provide real-world evidence that such assumptions may even prove to be conservative (see chart).\n\n\nIn sunny places solar power is now “shoulder to shoulder” with gas, coal and wind, says Cédric Philibert of the International Energy Agency, a prominent forecaster. He notes that since November 2014, when Dubai awarded a project to build 200MW of solar power at less than $60 a megawatt hour (MWh), auctions have become increasingly competitive.\n\nSome renewable-energy developers are gaining global reputations as record-breakers. The Dubai bid was won by Acwa Power, a Saudi company that is taking big strides across the Middle East and Africa, despite the oil-rich kingdom’s own half-hearted plans for solar development. In Morocco it has built the first phase of the world’s largest solar-thermal plant, which is using mirrors to generate heat to drive electricity turbines. Moody’s, a rating agency, says the completed plant will cut Morocco’s oil-import bills by 0.3% of GDP.\n\nLet the sunshine in\nItaly’s Enel Green Power (EGP) is also attracting attention. In February it won a tender to provide Peru with 20 years of power from solar PV at just under $48 a MWh. Just over a month later Mexico awarded it a similarly lengthy contract to generate solar power in the arid northern state of Coahuila at a price of about $40 per MWh. Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), a research firm, called it “the lowest subsidy-free solar contract we have ever seen”. EGP’s head of business development, Antonio Cammisecra, says there is a clear trend of falling prices. “We are trying to drive it,” he says.\n\nThe main factor behind the price drop is an 80% fall in the cost of solar panels since 2010, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency, an industry body. But Mr Cammisecra says that may now be close to ending. He travelled to China this week to persuade panel manufacturers to invest more in technological improvements, in order to increase the amount of solar energy that can be converted into electricity.\n\nAnalysts are also concerned that some providers’ auction bids may be over-aggressive, though companies can incur stiff penalties if they fail to complete a contract. Mr Philibert notes that some contracts may collapse because bidders are unable to raise finance.\n\nJenny Chase of BNEF says that in some cases “the model is being pushed to the absolute limit”. Indian firms, for example, are calculating development costs well below comparable global benchmarks. “I struggle to see how they will do this without cutting corners,” she says.\n\nJordan is a case in point. A Greek developer, Sunrise, last year agreed to charge $61 per MWh to build a 50MW solar plant north of Amman, which rival developers thought too cheap because of relatively high financing costs in Jordan. Last month Acwa Power bought the Jordanian unit in order to rescue the contract. Analysts say it is hard to see how Acwa will make money from it, but the gesture may help it win solar contracts in the future.\n\nThe kingdom offers more lessons on potential pitfalls. Like many developing countries, its national electricity company, NEPCO, has failed to expand its grid as quickly as private firms can erect solar parks, though it now has funding to build high-voltage transmission lines to connect the solar plants to Amman, the capital, where most electricity is consumed. (This problem is shared with China, which sometimes forces solar and wind plants to “curtail” their electricity output because the grid lacks the capacity to absorb it.)\n\nBut Jordan is blessed with geographical features that will let it expand its solar capacity once it has ironed out its problems. Engineers say that the area around Ma’an, with about 330 sunny days a year, has some of the best solar irradiance in the region. They add that, because of its altitude and terrain, heat and dust do not substantially lower the efficiency of the PV panels, as they do in neighbouring Saudi Arabia.\n\nSupport also comes from the top. King Abdullah has ordered solar panels to be installed on palaces and mosques, businessmen say. His most senior ministers drive Tesla electric vehicles. With more solar energy, the economic future of Jordan would be brighter and the country less at risk in a volatile region. All it needs is for the sun to energise its bureaucrats.",1472419232,t3_501heq,/r/Green/comments/501heq/follow_the_sun_solar_power_is_reshaping_energy/d70ekyz/

d6z61wy,4zu7q5,"If one goes back and reads the peer reviewed study this article was based on there are many flaws to the study. The study states that assuming a net zero CO2 atmospheric release from biofuel is incorrect, because of systemic changes that occur when biofuel is produced. The article wants to take into account land use changes from additional growth of corn, petroleum influx from the biofuel production process, and commodity market effects such as where the corn will be grown, transport costs, etc. All of these are reasonable points to argue about the limitations of our current models. However the article has failed to apply the same effects to petroleum usage and harvesting. The study only considers modern land use from petroleum harvesting, not the land use from creating the petroleum eons ago, which would be the counterpart to land use changes from biofuel production. Also the study has failed to take into account non-CO2 based effects on the climate, which are extensive and extremely complicated. However an interesting point of this study is that wood based biofuel production is much more likely to improve the climate than food based biofuel production, which is an idea worth pursuing. \n\n**TL;DR: The study the article was based on failed to apply its own criteria used to evaluate biofuel to petroleum.**",1472329335,t3_4zu7q5,/r/Green/comments/4zu7q5/biofuels_might_be_worse_for_climate_than_gasoline/d6z61wy/

d66dynr,4wcv5x,"Honestly, all of her remarks are very reasonable. It's hard for you to see, but you're the extremist on this subject. It's become a very popular thing to rail on in internet culture, but vaccines, although there was a big wave of dangerous fear mongering going on around them, are not perfect. I know someone whose little brother was instantly handicapped for life starting the day after a round of vaccines. If the mercury was really removed, which you even don't seem sure of, then that is because the public raised these concerns.\n\nI know how sure you are you are right, but that's why I see the views of this pro-science at all costs internet cult to be somewhat troubling. Concerns are raised by the public sometimes to counter industry. Sometimes this gets out of control, but sometimes that's what it takes to bring attention to an issue.\n\nFor example, Obama has recently signed legislation mandating GMO labeling, much to the dismay of the pro-science at all costs internet cult. In reality, outside of the cult, the whole civilized world does this. Almost the entire EU, Japan, China, Russia, Brazil, etc all have legistlation to some degree, because it seems common sense to them.

d66eg2f,4wcv5x,"Thimerosol ( the main mecury compund that was highlighted by anti vaxxers) was not dangerous. Just because something contains mecury doesn't make it dangerous, this is basic chemistry. Hydrogen is highly combustible and dangerous (Hindenburg anyone?) but when coupled with oxygen is necessary for life. This is the root problem of the anti-vax 'concern' movement. They grasp about .0002% of a subject and then try to challenge the experts on it. I admitted my level of ignorance because I am not a doctor or chemist, however I've done enough research and consultation of experts to recognize the realities of those fields.\n\nYou call me extremist and part of a 'science' cult. I am *incredibly* anti-corporate and distrustful of centralized authority. That's the beauty of science though, you can read the research and data and reproduce it. Now not everyone can gain the expertise to do that for even one field, let alone an array, but to say that the uneducated 'public' has more valid arguments then the evidence base of the field is absurd. \n\nYou seem to inherently dis-trust the centralized decision of the US (most likely because it disagrees with your espoused view on these subjects) and yet you accept the centralized decision of the EU? This is my problem with extremists on any side but that of empiricism, you don't seem to see the disconnect in your own reasoning. You point out nations that have enacted policies you favor as proof your side is right, and then dismiss nations that have taken an opposing stance as being too 'pro-corporate'. Yes the US is too pro-corporate, but so is France, Japan, Russia, Germany, etc. Just different types of interest and to different levels.\n\nI admit I am not an expert in a lot of these topics, but I am always suspicious/skeptical. I also trust that the body of research from the experts in the field is more likely to be correct and in the interest of the general public. After all the classic cases of scientific deception (Lead, tobacco cancer link, fossil fuels and climate change) were examples of a well funded minority opinion trying to muddy the waters. In fact it's similar to the groups that decry nuclear energy, GMO's, and vaccines. \n\nI choose to place my faith in the scientists and independent researchers who are experts in the field (with a healthy dose of skepticism and research). You want to call that 'cultish' fine. I would suggest you are part of a different cult, one highlighted by Isaac Asimov:“There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been.

It was the individual member states who one by one came to the (what most of the world thinks) obvious conclusion that as long as we are testing new methods of agriculture, the consumer has a basic right to know when s/he is eating it. The argument should simply end there, you yourself have the right to eat whatever you want to eat, and Linda Johanson with 4 kids and who volunteers at the library has the right not to if she doesn't want to.

To block what should be basic and normal information is a form of censorship, and to argue against basic labeling laws of any kind is to argue in favor of censorship, in favor of large corporations, and against individual people.\n\nThis is not the argument against GMO labeling by the way. The argument goes: GMO is really a diverse set of techniques that can insert various genes. At a broad definition literally everything we consume is a GMO as it was modified through bredding (a long term type of engineering) or more recently by forced mutation using radiation. Something like 70-80% of modern crop lines were created by bombarding seeds with radiation to force *random and uncontrolled* mutations and then the results were breed or discarded depending. Given the complexity of what we're talking about slapping a sticker that says GMO on an arbitrary subset of crops is not actually informing people, it's misleading them. Are we proposing identifying what gene was inserted? Are we going to include the research reports that are created for each new variant? Are we going to label crops that have undergone random nuclear mutation? \n\nOn to your nuclear comment, why don't you see it as viable? Fusion and Fission are some of our best shots for providing the power the third world will need, battery tech is just starting to get better, but especially with higher and higher energy density needs I think it is foolish to rule out the cleanest and safest (while admittedly most complicated and expensive to set up) energy generation we have.\n\nYou are, as judged by this exchange, absolutely what asimov was talking about, you say your standing up to ""a brutish, singleminded and bullying culture of authority appealing, approval seeking armchair internet scientists.""

The reason we're at this point is because the Green Party, and this goes for other aspiring political parties, has never been able to take the long view. They pop up for presidential elections, but don't want to establish a party base by running at local and state. Particularly damaging to the Green Party, more so than the Libertarians for example, is the simple fact that common wisdom prevails that the Greens are a single-issue party.\n\nTo be sure, gaining a high profile convert like Bernie would do a lot for their short term prospects, but it won't win them the election and it would be devastating for one person in particular -- Jill Stein. See, Jill thinks ""If I add Bernie to my ticket, people will vote for me."" but that isn't true, precisely.\n\nIn reality, people would be voting for Sanders, via Stein. This doesn't seem like an immediate problem, especially if it gets her into office, but should buyer's remorse set in when they realize that Jill isn't Bernie and her policies are not Bernie's, and ultimately that she can't accomplish anything because she doesn't have a single ally in the house or senate, then Jill will fall and take the Green Party tumbling with her to a place that none of them -- Sanders included -- can ever come back from.\n\nBy forming an alliance with a minor party, Sanders would be putting all his credibility and the complete viability of his movement in the future on the line. What he'd be risking is incalculable.\n\nHowever, if he bites his tongue and waits Hillary out?

It didn't work. This is what we got.

I am, too. I can't believe that, after developing the scientific method over the preceding centuries, we have decided to disregard its warnings when we learn that we are sawing off the branch on which we and our families and many other species depend. I can't believe that we are still so good at identifying problems, but have no will to solve them: plastics in the ocean, extinction of many – including beloved – species, our own overpopulation, ad nauseum. It seems to me that we have the means, but not the will, to solve all these problems.\n\nYou have found a home with the Greens, and congratulations. I've found one with Citizens' Climate Lobby, whose mission is to build the political will to pass a revenue neutral carbon fee and dividend. I like their principles, the way we work with everyone, and treat everyone with respect, gratitude, and admiration. \n\nI don't know if we're going to make it, as a species. It's difficult, being part of a group/species/nationality that is doing so much damage, to which I, too, contribute, and have contributed all my life. There is always a sense that I can do more, should do more, but lack the strategic know-how to be sure it's the right, effective, thing – or perhaps just lack the courage.\n\nThe Stoics say that we must take responsibility for all those things within our control, but not bother ourselves too much about the things over which we have no control. Neither side of that equation is as easy as it sounds. I love/adore/worship this planet, and the laws of Nature which have made it and humans fit so well together (until now). We can each do a few small things to put our shoulders to the wheel, but Iwe as individuals are powerless to save it all by ourselves, dammit. But what we can do – what is in our power and so is our responsibility – is choose the kind of people we want to be in these times. For my part, I want to be kind, but also insistent that we can be better. I want to set a good example. I want my passion to be informed by reason. And I'm hoping that by treating even opponents as potential allies and as friends, that I will win them over. And even if I don't, I'll have treated them well and not added to either their or my suffering. It's not a lot. Given our goal – to save the planet and our species from ourselves – it may not be enough. But I take courage from Atticus Finch:\n\n""I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It’s when you know you’re licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do."" - Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird\n\nWe may be ""licked,"" but we can't give up fighting for what we love and adore, can we? Do your best, man.

In any case the growing application of technologies such as CRISPR-cas and other techniques much more refined than 'traditional' genetic modification may affect the issue in a major way in the future. There is even the possibility that these techniques will be much more democratic than genetic modification presently is. \n\nWhat the article is concerned with, and I am as well, is the environment of corporate control in which this 'improvement' is taking place. This extends all the way up from patent law on genes, even naturally occurring ones, seeds and chemicals (yes I know glyphosate's patent has expired) to the sort of production that is encouraged and even demanded by this technology. The article dwells on the corporatization of farming in which a company manages to achieve a monopoly on both seed and the chemical that is intimately tied to that seed which leads to a treadmill of increasing capital input and increasing debt for the farmer, and then to industrial farming. \n\nThe situation of North American small farmers, bad as it is, may actually be enviable.

I've met quite a few farmers and most of them are very smart people, but they're in a business where their products *have* to be relatively cheap for people to buy. I mean, can you imagine a poor person buying organic limes at a Whole Foods that were picked from the coastal mountains of Chile less than a week ago?

I would say that it's around the same point that recycling was 20 years ago, where everyone was starting to understand the problem but you have people complaining about now having dozens of bins to put your trash in. You got some great researchers coming up with flashy farming techniques, and these are equivalent to creating a better bin for recycling. But the disconnect is that the consumer doesn't understand what piece of trash goes into what bin. Farmers today understand that using these new technologies are good for the future, but they can't afford to change their entire business plan, nor do they understand how this would directly benefit them today.

d5cwb2m,4sqc8d,"No, it isn't. It's the politics of math. It's also the delta between idealism and realism in a rational context. \n\nLook at the Brexit vote. A little different because of the electoral college, but close enough. Polling shows that a small percentage voted 'to send a message' or that 'they never thought their vote counted'. Another percentage didn't vote at all. Combined would that have made the difference? Who knows?\n\nFor the US and green, libertarian and other three party supporters I still contend that it isn't fear to compromise when the message is drown out. That means supporting the third party **and** fighting for change within the existing major parties that actually have a chance to win. It also means that when you have someone as vile as Trump you make damn sure the little progress that's been made isn't destroyed by a xenophobic, anti-environment tyrant.\n\nNo one cares about Occupy or any other cause when the victor is crowned.

Had we focused on influence and an alternative platform, in addition to messaging masses could appreciate (yes, elitist and who cares) there may be real progress. \n\nObama has publicly stated support for cap/trade (Years of Living Dangerously), and HRC has stated that she'd follow the same programs. Is there compromise that is unpalatable to a rational person - hell yes. No one should consider fracking, new offshore or tar sands, but if a little authorization prevents *more* it is still a better day than it was. To lose the executive branch would destroy Paris and other progress - gerrymandering has all but eliminated a liberal House until 2022 and possibly 2030+.\n\n1. Helped to export fracking to the rest of the world. That's not exactly accurate. She did support fracking, she did support oil companies advancing the technique globally and she has been unable to stop it, however, as S/S, Senator and candidate there is a long-game and strategy. If the other candidate is Trump - hell, he **denies climate change**. \n2.  Puts business interests and contributors first. To get elected - yup.\n3. Is irresponsible with national security information, then lies about it. And W murdered thousands and on and on. You can find leaked information (intentional or not) from anyone with said information.

Doesn't appear account able to the public- she hasn't held a news conference or faced reporters in an uncontrolled environment yet in 2016. If you were under investigation would your attorney want you to? This is a red herring. Few successful politicians put themselves there, and examples like Bernie, Warren and Frankin are wonderful, but still can't get there against a system that is corrupt. Is H corrupt? Yup. Can she win and advance the cause? Yup. \n6. Gives no indication that she'll 'fix' the banking sector- in fact they're among her biggest contributors. Not gonna be fixed. The issue isn't just the power of money or the scope, but the impact on foreign debt. If market stability were impacted by the idealistic changes in the banking system China, Saudi and Russian call over a trillion in bonds. There's nothing to fix the following day. This is the same thing with the 'drug war' - we can't **win** it because debtors can't repay with coffee (no matter how successful Starbucks is).\n\nI do understand the arguments and the wanting for the ideal now, but that ignores the glacial pace of change and the human conditions of greed and short-sightedness. I hate money in politics and I hate political ads, but I've given money to H, Bernie and Jill. Why? Will it make a difference? Nope. But it is a means to move the ship slowly. We lost the prevent climate change, keep the water clean, other battles, and there is so much money to be made fixing the problems in the eyes of Wall St, plus the money to be made today, that it must get worse.

d3aqi9d,4jtvr5,"People are free to purchase food with the *optional* label ""GMO-free"" if they have ideological reasons to avoid GE cultivars. This is how it works for kosher, halal, and organic: consumers with specialty demands get to pay the costs associated with satisfying those demands.\n\n*Mandatory* labels need to have justification. *Ingredients* are labeled for medical reasons: allergies, sensitivities like lactose intolerance, conditions like coeliac disease or phenylketonuria. *Nutritional content* is also labeled with health in mind. *Country of origin* is also often mandatory for tax reasons - but that's fairly easy to do because those products come from a different supply chain.\n\n**There is no justifiable reason to mandate labeling of GE products, because that label does not provide any meaningful information.** [GE crops do not pose any unique or elevated risks.](https://proactiontranshuman.wordpress.com/2013/07/24/why-am-i-pro-gmo/)\n\nGMO labels really don't tell the consumer anything:\n\n* Two varieties of GE corn could be more similar to each other than two varieties of non-GE corn. GE soy doesn't resemble GE papaya at all, so why would they share a label?\n* Many GE endproducts are chemically indistinguishable from non-GE (soybean oil, beet sugar, HFCS), so labeling them implies there will be testing which is simply not possible. \n* Most of the modifications made are for the benefit of farmers, not consumers - you don't currently know if the non-GE produce you buy is of a strain with higher lignin content, or selectively-bred resistance to a herbicide, or grows better in droughts. \n* We don't label other developmental techniques - we happily chow down on ruby red grapefruits which were developed by radiation mutagenesis (which is a USDA organic approved technique, along with chemical mutagenesis, hybridization, somatic cell fusion, and grafting). \n* Currently, GE and non-GE crops are intermingled at several stages of distribution. You'd have to vastly increase the number of silos, threshers, trucks, and grain elevators - drastically increasing emissions - if you want to institute mandatory labeling. \n\nInstituting mandatory GMO labels:\n\n* would cost untold millions of dollars (need to overhaul food distribution network)\n\n* would drastically increase emissions related to distribution\n\n* contravenes legal precedent (ideological labels - kosher, halal, organic - are optional)\n\n* stigmatize perfectly healthy food, hurting the impoverished\n\n* is redundant when GMO-free certification already exists\n\n\nConsumers do not have a right to know every characteristic about the food they eat. That would be cumbersome: people could demand labels based on the race or sexual orientation of the farmer who harvested their produce. People could also demand labels depicting the brand of tractor or grain elevator used. People might *rightfully* demand to know the associated carbon emissions, wage of the workers, or pesticides used. But *mandatory* labels are more complicated than ink - have a look at this [**checklist of changes required to institute labeling**](http://i.imgur.com/ntnGPFd.jpg). \n\n[Here is a great **review of labeling**](http://www.cast-science.org/file.cfm/media/products/digitalproducts/CAST_Issue_Paper_54_web_optimized_29B2AB16AD687.pdf), and [here's **another more technical one**](http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF14/20150618/103641/HHRG-114-IF14-Wstate-GiddingsV-20150618.pdf).\n\n**Organized movements in support of mandatory GMO labeling are funded by organic groups**:\n\n* [Vermont Right to Know GMOs](http://www.vtrighttoknowgmos.org/who-we-are/#supporters)\n* [Just Label It](http://www.justlabelit.org/about-just-label-it/)\n* [US Right to Know](http://usrtk.org/donors/)\n\nHere are some [quotes about labeling from anti-GMO advocates](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/GLP-right-to-know-infographic.pdf) about why they want labeling.\n",1463604765,t1_d39tj4m,/r/Green/comments/4jtvr5/pros_and_cons_of_gmos/d3aqi9d/

Many many people believe that mature forests become very close to carbon neutral and advocate harvest to initiate a younger forest and increase carbon uptake. I'm not against harvesting, but we probably shouldn't be using that as a motivation. Lacking data about soil carbon (and other sequestration in general as opposed to just above ground growing tree stock) is a serious weakness in any study like this and if you didn't take it into account when looking at young forest growth, then you likely didn't take it into account when you looked at how much carbon was released when the mature forest was removed in the first place.

d2ayh2c,4foudq,"A few points on that:\n\n1) ""Organic' and 'non-GMO' are not equivalent terms. In terms of the former it not only contains all sorts of connotations that are frankly 'flaky', but obscures what in my opinion is the *major* problem, centralized control over the food system in a transnational web of corporate control. The great majority, perhaps all !, of the present deforestation takes places in the context of this international system. In many countries the corporate use of GMOs is part of this growing monopoly. GMOs are a tool that has to be evaluated in a case by case manner. They have dangers that are ignored by proponents and exaggerated by opponents. They have benefits that are exaggerated by proponents and ignored by opponents. The biggest danger by far is that they promote the monopolization and centralization of agriculture. \n\n2)The 'efficiency' of organic production also varies. It isn't *always* less efficient even in the usual commodity market or for the average farmer. A big 'gain' in such production is when it is carried out in a decentralized cooperative neighbourhood manner, and many experiments have demonstrated its efficiency in providing lower cost food for poorer people. Such production has benefits that aren't accounted for in the usual calculations of the commodity market where costs are often socialized so that they are paid by society in general or small farmer 'victims'. Similarly the benefits which often accrue to higher income groups in the typical market system are unevenly distributed.

I figured that way more people would use something if it was easy/nice to use and there was more choice. The more choice, the more likely you are to find something useful you can swap with someone (potentially). I think there are loads of people out there who would maybe use this kind of thing if they just knew it was there. Using Airbnb as an example... their idea of people renting rooms out was something you could do in all kinds of places on the internet - including Craig's list - but they made using Airbnb a great experience.

d1xvdty,4e7dxs,"This reminds me of an excerpt from Naomi Klein's ""This Changes Everything"":\n\nThe “market-based” climate solutions favored by so many large foundations and adopted by many greens have provided an invaluable service to the fossil fuel sector as a whole. For one, they succeeded in taking what began as a straightforward debate about shifting away from fossil fuels and put it through a jargon generator so convoluted that the entire climate issue came to seem too complex and arcane for non-experts to understand, seriously undercutting the potential to build a mass movement capable of taking on powerful polluters. As Drexel University sociologist Robert Brulle has observed, “The movement to technical and market-based analyses as the core of reform environmentalism gutted whatever progressive vision the movement had previously held. Rather than engaging the broader public, reform environmentalism focuses debate among experts in the scientific, legal, and economic communities. It may provide technical solutions to specific problems but it neglects the larger social dynamics that underlie environmental degradation.”\n\nThese policies have also fed the false perception that a full transition to renewable energy is technically impossible—since if it were possible, why would all these well-meaning green groups be spending so much of their time pushing trading schemes and singing the praises of natural gas, even when extracted through the ecologically destructive method of fracking? Often these compromises are rationalized according to the theory of “low-hanging fruit.” This strategy holds, in essence, that it’s hard and expensive to try to convince politicians to regulate and discipline the most powerful corporations in the world. So rather than pick that very tough fight, it’s wiser and more effective to begin with something easier. Asking consumers to buy a more expensive, less toxic laundry detergent, for instance. Making cars more fuel-efficient. Switching to a supposedly cleaner fossil fuel. Paying an Indigenous tribe to stop logging a forest in Papua New Guinea to offset the emissions of a coal plant that gets to stay open in Ohio. With emissions up by about 57 percent since the U.N. climate convention was signed in 1992, the failure of this polite strategy is beyond debate.\n\nAnd yet still, at the upper echelons of the climate movement, our soaring emissions are never blamed on anything as concrete as the fossil fuel corporations that work furiously to block all serious attempts to regulate emissions, and certainly not on the economic model that demands that these companies put profit before the health of the natural systems upon which all life depends. Rather the villains are always vague and unthreatening—a lack of “political will,” a deficit of “ambition”—while fossil fuel executives are welcomed at U.N. climate summits as key “partners” in the quest for “climate solutions.”",1460333405,t3_4e7dxs,/r/Green/comments/4e7dxs/mainstream_environmentalism_protects_industrial/d1xvdty/

d1uo4qn,4dvbwl,"Forbes doesn't allow ad blockers, they can fuck off.\n\n---\nConcrete is the most widely used building material in the world, but despite its association with the modern city, it has been used throughout history. The ancient Babylonians and Egyptians built structures with a mixture of clay and pebbles, and parts of the Great Wall of China used cement-like material to bind blocks together. In its simplest form, concrete consists of small particles of a hard material (known as aggregate) bonded together by a cement and water, but there’s a huge amount of chemistry involved in finding exactly the right combination of ingredients.\n\nBut concrete doesn’t generally inspire excitement amongst urban dwellers. Most of the stuff we see around us is dull and grey, and it often ages rather badly. As well as that, its production is incredibly energy-intensive – some suggest that the manufacture of Portland cement (the industry standard) accounts for 5 % of the world’s CO2 emissions. Thankfully, around the world, efforts are underway to green-ify concrete, or at least to look at new ways to use it.\n\nFirst up is a British company called Cemfree who, as their name suggests, have developed a cement-free concrete. Instead of a cocktail of calcium carbonate, silicon, oxygen, iron ore, and aluminium oxide, their concrete is held together using a material called ground-granulated blast furnace slag; a waste product from the steel industry. The big benefit of this is that it reduces the carbon dioxide production – Cemfree claim that if the Empire State Building had been built with their concrete, it would have produced 13,319 fewer tonnes of CO2. Many in the construction sector remain sceptical of the performance of this material. When researching for my upcoming book, I was told that producing concrete without cement was like ‘baking a cake without flour’, but the tests show that it performs at least as well as traditional concrete in many applications. Definitely one to watch.\n\nAnother material beginning to make waves in the concrete world is Taktl. Taktl is an ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) – it is incredibly strong under compression (when it’s squeezed) thanks to the numerous tiny and tightly packed particles that make up its structure. This also makes it durable and less water-hungry than standard concrete, and means that you can use less of it while still reaching the required strength. But what makes Taktl different is its model “UHPC typically goes to market as a ready-mix that comes from one central location. To reduce the material’s environmental footprint, we wanted to do something completely different”, said Lauren Flannery, co-founder of Taktl (and former chemist). “We worked with G.TECZ, a research facility in Germany, to develop formulations that could be adapted to provide the performance we need, but with only locally-sourced materials”. Their vision then is to open a series of regional plants to produce Taktl, while controlling the variation that typically comes from changing the components of a high-performance concrete. To be very simplistic, they’re following the example of chain restaurants, in which local ingredients are processed in a standardised way to produce the same ‘taste’ everywhere. I like this concept, and judging by the number of projects Taktl have been involved in, it seems that architects do too.\n\nI must say though, that my favourite innovative concrete was inspired by the dark spots of moss you sometimes see growing on buildings. Developed by Dr Sandra Manso-Blanco during her PhD, this bioreceptive concrete offers a perfect surface for microorganisms already present in the air to grow and flourish. But it’s not just a case of leaving concrete out to get mouldy. Dr Manso-Blanco (now collaborating with the BiotA lab at the Bartlett School of Architecture) has designed a four-layered structure – standard concrete comes first, followed by a layer of waterproofing. The bioreceptive concrete layer is next and it’s been designed with a particular roughness and porosity – it offers an incredibly comfortable ‘mattress’ for the lichen and fungi to land on. And the top layer is designed to collect and store water. Dr M-B told me that, ‘only the inner layer is structurally important to the building, and only the outer layer encourages growth.’ So what does this mean for the buildings of tomorrow? Well, just like trees and flowers, certain types of lichen and fungi flourish in different seasons, and no two cities have exactly the same mix of microorganisms in the air. In theory at least, bioreceptive concrete could provide buildings unique to their surroundings and which change throughout the year.\n\nAnd that’s just three of the many products under development! Back in January, Sujata Kundu told you about a conductive concrete that can be used in de-icing, and I’m planning to introduce you to 3D printed and self-healing concretes in future articles too….

d1vepm1,4dvbwl,"Worked on Alkali-Activated ""green"" concrete during my first few years at university. This is nothing new, unfortunately. The main reason these ""green"" cements will never make it to mainstream usage is because of the huge amount of control Portland (they basically have a monopoly of the cement industry) has over the standards for concrete in general, namely the ASTM standards required for any manufacturer of concrete to pass before selling their product.\n\nWe spent years trying to get our concrete to pass the required standards, but they are set intentionally high as to be almost impossible to be passed.\n\nIt's really a shame. Alkali-Activated cements outlast Portland cement by 100 years, have comparable strength, and cost more than 10 times less to produce.

But installing rooftop gardens on every structure is very resource intensive, and removing all the roads is unrealistic.\n\nAlso, many of the calories from animal products in my 675 cals/day came from off-site feed (compost scraps and leftover bread from nearby coop and bakery, and flowers for our bees).  I estimate we were getting about 500 calories/day from purely on-site inputs.

This study seems like a good estimate.\n\nOne last note: I suspect that chickens, ducks, and especially bees integrated into perennial plantings augment the total yield, rather than competing with plant crops in providing a calorie yield to humans.

Mushrooms symbiotically connect and with trees, and they share resources, effectively extending their root network. The trees are then more resilient to plague, drought, and grow faster, therefore sequester in more carbon more quickly. Be sure to label your compostable plastic with a large biodegradable label so people are aware they can throw it into their gardens soil, like I do. \n\nGlass is okay too, choose a type of bottle or jar that is still useful to the customer after they have consumed your beverage. I often buy specific beverages based on their container. Wide mouth jars are good if you can fit your hand in them for easy cleaning. Bottles with the 'lightning closure"" are my favourite because they can be opened and closed by the one hand while it is carrying the bottle. Especially useful for water bottles. This is good because your creating an opportunity for people to continue using your products energy footprint well after purchase. If you choose this option, also keep your labels easy to clean off. Your labels glue should come off with hot water. Acetone, paint thinner, rubbing alcohols, and steel wool should not be necessary to remove the label.

czxfm3a,45d2ck,"Makes sense.  \n\nNeonics are known to be one of many agents contributing to colony collapse, but there are other causes we can address that don't also have benefits for our agricultural use, i.e., varroa and acarine mites, ants, hive beetles, foul and chalkbrood, deformed wing virus, IIV-6, and nosema.  \n\nCompared to varroa or nosema, for instance, the impact on colony health from normal levels of neonic contamination of pollen is relatively low.  You can kill a colony with neonics, of course, but in exactly the same way you can kill mice with aspartame: by raising the dosage far beyond anything likely to be encountered, then running a linear regression.\n\nThere are a lot of things beekeepers can to to help their broods fight off various diseases: mesh bottom hives, to improve airflow and allow fecal matter and mites to fall (helps with varroa, acarine, and nosema); queen selection for hygenic behaviors (helps a lot with varroa, foul and chalkbrood); good construction, such as having a slip ring around your hive stand legs, can limit the ability of ants and beetles to enter a hive.\n\nNosema is a huge problem, though: it's hard to diagnose without sampling (e.g., mascerating and examining under a microscope) your bees, is absolutely disasterous to a hive, and has been detected in most instances of CCD, along with IIV-6 - whether it be a cause or a symptom of a weak hive, it's almost certainly the killing blow.  \n\nThere's an antibiotic treatment that inhibits nosema spores' reproduction in bees' foregut - but it doesn't kill the spores.  Best way to create resistance, that.  It only takes one line that is still able to reproduce in spite of the treatment to have a superbug on your hands.\n\nMeanwhile, as a beekeeper, have good hygiene yourself: Whenever you harvest a frame or super, clean it thoroughly, then sterilize it chemically (fumigation with 80% acetic acid.  Be careful with this stuff, but it will kill literally everything living in that wood).  You'll want to weaken the populations of anything the bees had that cycle.  Also, occasionally change out your body supers (just the box, not the frames) for freshly sterilized ones, and sterilize your hive entrance and bottom mesh.  You can't get all the potentially-nosema-carrying bee-poop off the frames, but you can certainly clean it off the floors and walls.  You can also acid-sterilize honey frames without affecting its value to the hive.\n",1455294604,t3_45d2ck,/r/Green/comments/45d2ck/trudeau_wont_back_ban_on_pesticides_linked_to_bee/czxfm3a/

czy1y3e,45d2ck,"Well, feral bees are presently more resistant to CCD in general than domestic broods - mind, this is after feral broods were knocked down to something like a tenth of their natural populations, while the domestics were protected by anti-mite treatments from a couple of the causes of CCD.\n\nInstead of helping avoid CCD, though, treatment only led to miticide resistant mites, with treatment-reliant bee keepers stuck fighting an uphill battle.\n\nIn terms of resistance of neonics themselves, I don't know that testing _between_ bee populations has been done.  Too many variables to isolate: does the feral population deal worse in captivity in general than the domestic?  Is the feral population a generally stronger swarm?  \n\nI mean, I'm sure you could design a test around it, but there's always going to be fouling factors, and the effect of neonics is already so small it took a huge epidemiological effort to demonstrate it was there and a contributor with a small margin for error.\n\nMeanwhile, trapping and starting hives with new feral queens, close enough to your broods that they're likely to mate, is always a good thing; genetic diversity strengthens the hive, and left unchecked, domesticated bees will quickly get badly inbred.",1455329035,t1_czy04t6,/r/Green/comments/45d2ck/trudeau_wont_back_ban_on_pesticides_linked_to_bee/czy1y3e/

LMP-103S has 6% higher specific impulse and 30% higher impulse density than hydrazine monopropellant. Additionally, hydrazine is highly toxic and carcinogenic, while LMP-103S is only moderately toxic. LMP-103S is UN Class 1.4S allowing for transport on commercial aircraft, and was demonstrated on the Prisma satellite in 2010. Special handling is not required. LMP-103S could replace hydrazine as the most commonly used monopropellant.\n\nI was hoping to find this might be a useful flight or transport fuel, not just a spaceflight fuel.

cyvom9e,40kggj,"> nuclear is limited to below 1 TW\n\nIn what sense?  I mean, we already have about a quarter TW of nuclear.  What would be the limiting factor here?  Water?  High temperature reactors get around that: you can air-cool them.  Fuel?    Reasonably expected improvements in efficiency can double the value of each unit of fuel; higher burnup can multiply it by a factor of 5; reprocessing multiplies each unit of fuel by a factor of 20,  alternate fuel cycles by a factor of hundreds.\n\nMeanwhile, we have a mere 70 years of fuel available at current usage _that we can extract at < $100 / kg_.  Double the price and 10x as much is available to us.  Get the price to $800 / kg, and we can extract uranium from seawater - multiplying the stores by a factor of about a million.\n\nKeep in mind that the _value_ of natural uranium, as energy, burned in a conventional reactor, is between $4,000 and $8,000 / kg.  The fuel costs for nuclear is about 1.2¢/kWh.  Even if fuel costs raise to $800 / kg - 9.6¢/kWh, raising the price of electricity from 12.7¢/kWh to 21.1¢ / kWh - we're still talking cheaper than some are suggesting for solar.\n\nMeanwhile, we need not go that far for a while.  The first doubling of price makes reprocessing profitable enough we could _stop_ uranium mining for a couple hundred years.\n\nI submit to you that we have enough spent fuel to power our world at the world's projected maximum 2050 consumption levels of _all_ energy - 75 TW, including current inefficiencies with combustion (which we keep, since conversion of nuclear heat and electricity to liquid fuels, and fertilizers for which we'll continue to have need, has around the same levels of practical end-to-end efficiency as the mining and combustion of fossil fuels), and including excess for desalination and ocean deacidification (both vitally important for keeping below 2⁰C) - for the next 100 years.  Additionally, there's enough already-mined thorium to do the same for another 400 years - all without digging a single additional hole in the ground.  \n\nAfter that, we could, compared to our coal mining infrastructure, ""sip"" at the earth's fissile reserves: at 500 years on, we'd expect to have reached the maximum practical fission efficiency - about 9 GWh / g; this implies that a 75 TW world would mine a maximum of 5,300 million tonnes of rock for uranium and thorium per year, yielding 70 tonnes of U-235, 9,400 tonnes of U-238, and 64,000 of Th-232, with a total embodied energy of 1,600 PWh (112 TW heat, 75 TW electricity).  \n\nBy comparison, the world presently mines in excess of 5,700 million tonnes of coal annually just for its current total energy output of 38 PWh - all of which would have become obsolete.  Scaled to 75 TW (which would be insane), coal would have a mining footprint of 98.6 billion tonnes / year - 18.6 times what's needed for nuclear's 75 TW scenario.\n\nWe already have reprocessing available, and our spent fuel can last us while we work out thorium - which is only about 10 years off, going by regulatory filings.\n\nThis is one of the reasons I think a deep geological repository is a dumb idea: it excludes the possibility that we'll recycle the fuel - an inevitability if we plan to depend on nuclear energy.  We should have a reprocessing center built at the largest nuclear power plant in each state.\n\nReprocessing and alternate fuel cycles help the ""waste problem"" in another big way: it reduces the total mass of the waste, per kWh, by a factor of about 100, but it also reduces its time-to-background - from 250,000 years to about 300.  In a conversation where people are concerned about what legacy we leave to future generations, this is huge: the maintenance problem is limited to those people who will continue to reap the benefits that caused it.\n\nNot to mention that unlike virtually everything else (including solar), the waste for nuclear energy is a well-contained solid that we keep in essentially impenetrable vaults as it is.  Weapons production, not so much (see: Hanford), but I'm not advocating for nuclear weapons.\n\nMeanwhile, I think the IPCC's build-rate - 115 GW of nuclear per year - is completely achieveable.  France, during the Messmer plan (1974-1989), built 56 reactors with a total annualized generation of 44 GW, using a population of 54 million people.  Scale that worldwide, and humanity has the potential, from a labor standpoint, to build 380 GW / year.\n\nA potential down side of this might be an increase in accident rates - however, when working out the risk there, we have to consider the nature of past accidents.\n\nFirst, Chernobyl.  Chernobyl - an RBMK - was a different sort of reactor than the types I propose, and had a lot of inherent safety problems: Primarily: the design is of a type that, when the coolant boils, the reactor goes into overdrive.  It was almost inevitable that at least one of these would explode: maintaining an RBMK requires constant discipline and vigilance.  That's not the kind of thing I want built, ever.  Additionally, its lack of a secondary containment vessel at all meant that the explosion exposed, essentially, Europe to the entire volatile and soluble contents of the reactor core, and the local community to its non-volatile contents.  This, too, is nothing I suggest we do.\n\nNext, TMI - Three Mile Island did the public literally no harm, except panic.\n\nFukushima was the closest to a modern reactor that failed - the failure incited by a natural disaster that killed 15,000.  By comparison, the human impact has been small: 0-1 additional cancers per year, 1,600 dead and and 300,000 people displaced from evacuation - one whose scope was larger than was necessary, even going by figures on the ground at the time.  \n\nTalking about radbio for a second: some evacuation _was_ necessary: I-131 concentrates in the human thyroid, and has a half-life far shorter than its biological half-life.  If you consume it, you it is going to decay in your body, all in one place, among a cell line which typically replaces its cells very slowly.  The instigation of cell death by absorption of I-131's beta rays causes an increase in cell reproduction in tissues that are not made for that; copying errors happen, and papillary carcinoma becomes likely.\n\nOn the up side, PC is very survivable: slow growing and low-symptomatic, 94% survive after first diagnosis, and 100% when caught early on (prior to our ability to treat it, many people died _with_ PC rather than _of_ it).  Incidentally, this is why thyroid screening programs always result in a higher rate of thyroid cancer than the general population: screening exposes most of the asymptomatic cases that were already there.\n\nStill, it's better not to load the local healthcare system with a high demand for synthroid and constant endocrinologist visits: it's estimated that, if no one had evacuated, there would be an additional 164 cancers in the area, and about 10 dead of them on a 20 year timeline.  So evac.\n\nFukushima released 511 PBq of I-131 - about 15g, or 6.89e22 atoms - which is nonetheless enough to kill you and a friend outright were you to consume all of it.  The weather and water patterns around FD-I should have been used to determine the evacuated areas, rather than the ""radius"" model: the exclusion zone was both largely free of I-131, and didn't include a significant portion of the downstream radioactive plume.\n\n[*Continued in reply*]",1452628237,t1_cyvc8et,/r/Green/comments/40kggj/saving_the_planet_requires_nuclear_power/cyvom9e/

Cs-137 will take longer to go away - it's only 0.16 half-lives later now, and 12 PBq (3.36 kg) still remain.\n\nBut by 90 days after the reactors were shut down, the total I-131 in the atmosphere was 426 TBq (5.75e19 atoms) and _very_ well-dispersed - it's likely that much of the world had an atom or two of the stuff at this point.  90 more, and it was 355 GBq (4.79e16 atoms).  The residents of FD-I, in my opinion, could have returned home at this point.  Certainly, they could return by Jan 5, 2013: the iodine had entirely decayed off.\n\nBasically: nuclear scares far more effectively than it kills.  There's a ""there"" there, but it's much smaller than I'd been led to believe by Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, and Friends of the Earth (Greenpeace has lost a lot of credibility it once had with me for other reasons as well, like fighting - sometimes illegally - against GMOs that can lower humanity's footprint on the earth).\n\nIn fact, if you total up all the deaths from all the nuclear accidents over the years, and divide it by the energy produced, you get a _lower_ number than you get for literally anything else, solar and wind included.\n\nSo we _can_ do it, we can do it with little overall risk, and what risks remain, we can manage.  Should we?\n\nIt's low-carbon - with lifecycle emissions on par with wind and about a quarter that of solar.  It's reliable - outages account for 5-10% of operating time, and are planned well ahead-of-time.  \n\nIt's cheap on the grand scale - on par with wind and cheaper than solar for annualized output, but builds are necessarily granular, and therefore relatively expensive up-front: you can't just plop in a 1 MW reactor - they come in 500 MW and up.  At a current cost of $6-8 / W, you're looking at a mininmum investment of $3 billion on a 6 year project, or $8 billion on a 10 year project (the delta largely dependent on how much legal obstruction the plant faces).  So you end up either getting loan guarantees or charging your electrical customers extra - or both.  10 years down the line, the plant is a profit center - but 10 years is a _very_ long lead time for your typical ADD investor.\n\nLet's put carbon and money aside: what strengths nuclear has in reducing CO2 emissions over coal, renewables largely also have.  Cost difficulties are different, but largely equivalent with respect to fossil generators - when you're buying at the 75 TW level, granularity hardly comes into it: you need big, and you need a lot of it.  The cost per annualized watt-hour is what will matter, and wind, solar, coal, and nuclear all cost within one standard deviation of the broader spectrum of energy generators.\n\nWhat about other factors, like mining?  We've already seen that the mining footprint for a 75 TW nuclear world would need to process 5,300 million tonnes of rock a year.  Most of this - 5299 million tonnes - would be either returned to the ground or refined for other purposes (thorium and rare earths, like neodymium, are usually found together).  This is not exactly true, but a maximum estimate, should we be forced to burn rocks for our fuel.\n\nAt least for uranium, we need not even process rock itself: the majority of uranium deposits are precipitates from seawater beds in porous rock; this lends them to in-situ leaching - essentially, decontaminating uranium-containing aquifers by loading them with complexing agent and oxidant, pumping the water and chemicals through, and recovering the uranium from the solution.  At the end of life for an ISL mine, the water is purified and pumped through the aquifer, until it comes out below a given set of requirements (in the US, it's EPA potable water requirements). ISL presently accounts for about 47% of all uranium mining, and nearly all the uranium mining in the US, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan. It's cheaper than conventional mining, and is a far cleaner method of extracting uranium.  ISL mines currently account for 1.4 million tonnes of known uranium resources at or below $80/kg, 5 million tonnes at $130/kg, and 20 million tonnes at $500kg.\n\nWith thorium and rare earths, monazite sands are the main source, which are about 6-12% thorium oxide, rather than the 12 ppm in average crust used to calculate the 5,300 tonne number - meaning, for the thorium end, we'd only need to process ~0.5-1 million tonnes of sand a year.\n\nStill, we wouldn't need to go there for a while: there's presently 2.6 million tonnes of thorium already mined and stockpiled worldwide - presently treated as mining waste for the rare earths that make the magic happen in all our technology.  This represents 23,000 PWh of electricity, plus 35,000 PWh of heat - 35 years worth of carbon-free energy at 75 TW, assuming we use no process heat.  More than double that, if we're smart about it.\n\nCompare to solar: Large, modern solar panels get about 2.8 mW annualized output per gram of panel, and last about 25 years, at which point they need replaced.  Without recycling, that's a mining load of _at least_ 1 billion tonnes of material per year in the 75 TW scenario, not counting tailings and special inputs - and 27,000 million tonnes of panels online at all times.\n\nCompare to wind: A modern wind turbine will get about 14.1 mW / g annualized, and last about 30 years before they need replaced.  That's a mining load of 176 million tonnes / year at 75 TW, again, not counting tailings, with 5,300 million tonnes of turbine.\n\nOf course, since we're including the mass of the replacable plant parts now in the lifecycle mining footprint, we should include nuclear's: ~12 W/g (AP-1000), 60 year average lifespan, 104,000 tonnes / year @ 75 TW, 6.3 million tonnes of reactor.\n\nThorCon, as an example of a possible future reactor, does somewhat worse: 0.65 W/g, 4 year lifespan, 28 million tonnes / year, 115 million tonnes of reactor online at a time.\n\nClearly, whatever we do, we should recycle the previous generation of plants into new plants - still, recycling take energy too, and we'd want to minimize the energy re-invested into energy production, for the same reason we minimize anything else: it's expensive, and it impacts the environment.  Moreover, recycling rarely recovers all of a given thing - so there will still be a mining load.  If we start small, we stay small.\n\nIn conclusion, it's possible to get where we need to be with nuclear energy, it's possible to do it in the necessary timeline using _only_ nuclear, it's (relatively) safe to do so, it's sustainable to do so, and it's lower footprint to do so.  \n\nI'm not arguing for using only nuclear: the training gap is lighter if we go nuclear + renewables, since the training for installing solar panels and wind turbines is no more complex than basic construction.  The argument for 100% nuclear could be made, and is well-embedded in my argument, but without the training gap being addressed, it's less likely we'll reach the 115 GW / year the IPCC says is necessary, the 380 GW / year that France indicated is achievable, or the 2,150 GW / year we'd need to match 75 TW, for desalination, replacement of all fossil fuel use, and ocean deacidification.\n\nI want massive investment in _all_ carbon-free energy.  The main obstacle is the irrational obstructionism of nuclear energy from the environmentalism movement that I've grown up as a part of.  We think nuclear energy will cut into renewables investments - then, out of the other side of our mouths, we incomprehensively claim that renewables are a more attractive offering.  We criticize the safety of nuclear's 40 deaths / PWh, while rooftop solar kills 44 / PWh, oil kills 36,000, and coal kills 170,000 / PWh.  We pine for continuously disappointing battery technologies whose only feature is to enable intermittents to cost society more for the same product nuclear would produce, and create _yet another toxic waste stream_ - one that won't necessarily be permanently contained.\n\nIn my opinion, we should commit to doing nuclear sustainably, stop our Green movement from its historical obstructionism (and fearmongering despite the evidence) on all things nuclear, start training more people to build nuclear plants, and seriously step up our nuclear build out.",1452628274,t1_cyvom9e,/r/Green/comments/40kggj/saving_the_planet_requires_nuclear_power/cyvonav/
cyxo3u3,40kggj,"> Gen IV reactors should be less expensive, fewer materials used in construction and inherently safer so lower insurance costs. \n\nWell, maybe.  Not all Gen IV designs have atmospheric pressure cores.  Of particular note are high temperature gas reactors, which operate at _higher_ pressures than conventional nukes.  That said, if Gen IV is to succeed, I'd very much like it to be via molten salts and, to a lesser extent, metal-cooled (which are both atmospheric pressure design classes).\n\nBut yeah, in conventional nukes, you have your core very much wanting to be all over your landscape, held back by whatever structural materials and safety systems you can throw at it.

As little dairy and eggs as possible as well, but mostly cut your meat consumption. \n\n\nAnimal agriculture is the single largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and soil/water pollution worldwide. Here's a straightforward Scientific American article on the environmental impacts of meat (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/meat-and-environment/) and a United Nations report from last year on the need for a transition to global veganism in order to halt the climate crisis (http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Portals/24102/PDFs/PriorityProductsAndMaterials_Report.pdf).",1451943933,t3_3zfszi,/r/Green/comments/3zfszi/how_can_i_live_greener_waste_diet_beauty_wise_etc/cylzt1i/

However, limiting red meat consumption is hugely helpful. Bison meat is also more environmentally-friendly than cattle (cattle is just generally really, really bad). Start by trying to limit your red meat consumption to once a week. \n    \nComposting is a great way to start small and you may be surprised how much of your trash can be composted (paper napkins, paper towels, white cotton). \n    \nBuy used goods instead of new.\n    \nYou can also look into maximizing your recycling for those items which you are not ready to eliminate. For example, Terracycle takes old toothbrushes and toothpaste tubes (as well as LOTS of other items). Schools and community groups can get paid for collecting Terracycle items. I drop mine off at the community reuse center. \n    \nAlso previously mentioned is reducing your energy usage. Bike or carpool when you can (it also saves you on gas and wear and tear!). Compete against yourself to see if you can reduce your energy and water consumption each month until it's half of what it is now (that is actually not that hard to do). Hang your laundry to dry. Pee in the shower. Take reusable utensils to work rather than using dispensable everyday. Have a water cup at work. Take note every time you throw something into the trash and look into whether there is a way to eliminate the need for that item and, if not, to recycle it.\n    \nIf you give more details on what you are looking for.

The costs of lower carbon alternatives become more attractive because they are suddenly less expensive in relation to higher carbon output options.

Research and development subsidies are not the same as production subsidies.  I think more R&D subsidies need to go towards wind, solar and nuclear.   However, nuclear has prevented many millions of tons of emissions already and makes up 60% of clean energy in the US.  High capacity factors means that losing just a few nuclear reactors means losing proportionally at least 4X the same amount of solar generation capacity.\n\nWaste disposal is an artificial problem created by politicians.  The best thing to do is to reuse the ""waste"" in new types of reactors that can get more energy out than just the 4% that is typically used in light water reactors.\n\nIn any situation you have to consider the alternatives.  The only alternatives to nuclear are coal and fracked gas used in addition to solar and hydro.  Other sources are sometimes available, but those are the main sources except for hydro which is already tapped out and has it's own consequences.  Shouldn't you compare accident liability problems that governments have to get involved with to other disasters (short and long term)?  Consider the number of deaths from coal: larger or smaller than nuclear including the worst accidents.  Already people are moving back in within 15 miles of Fukushima.

While it's a real phenomenon, I think it can be mitigated. For example, a smart thermostat + good insulation = a warm home when the occupants need it. Perceived comfort is what matters, so they won't use more heating than they need.\n\nBoth roadmaps assume use of current technology.

But I think it's pretty self evident if you read them. By ""thought out"" I mean that enough thinking and research has been done to justify their legitimacy - and not dismiss them out of hand. By contrast, most climate denier arguments can be dismissed with only a few minutes of examination. \n\n> you aren't interested in science, you are interested in politics and calling out bullshit on things that you didn't even attempt to discuss.\n\nWe are not talking about science at this point, or at least not the scientific method. \n\nWe're talking about economic, political, cultural and engineering choices which should be informed by science, but cannot be made with the scientific method - because the data is lacking and there is no opportunity for repeatable experiments at the scale of a global energy transformation. \n\nOf course, we should use evidence and be methodical in how we make these decisions. So if you mean science in the broad sense of evidence based decision making, then I agree.

[According to the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency](https://www.oecd-nea.org/press/press-kits/economics-FAQ.html), building a nuclear plant takes 4-8 years (partly depending on where you build it). \n\nThough it's worth pointing out that nuclear projects often take longer (and cost more) than what the industry promises. Famously, [Olkiluoto 3 nuclear project in Finland](http://www.carbonbrief.org/new-nuclear-finlands-cautionary-tale-for-the-uk) is nine years behind schedule and three times over budget. A project like that becomes 'to big to fail' so more money keeps getting plowed in and more compromises keep getting made. Worse, a failure has the potential to be not only costly, but catastrophic. \n\nSo renewables can iterate faster, meaning their deployment can improve more quickly.\n\nAnd yes, I enjoy calling out bullshit.\n ",1452160693,t1_cyouk5i,/r/Green/comments/3xwqyg/sanders_climate_plan_insufficient_outdated/cyp6h3l/
