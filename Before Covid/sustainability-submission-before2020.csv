et03he,1579816238,Economics major sustainability minor ?,"Hey as the title says I’m in college right now majoring in economics and minoring in sustainability. As I look at the classes I’ve taken it seems I have an interest in cities as I’ve taken urban economics, and sustainable architecture and urban design, energy and it’s social uses, and environmental geography. I’ve also taken a management class, marketing, and digital marketing. I needed more credits to graduate so I recently decided to add a sustainability minor. \n\nI just wanted to know what job prospects look like in this field, and what I could do with my specialization. I don’t have any internship experiences yet because I am unsure about where to look. I have an interest in a wide varieties of fields from business to marketing to public heath and many other ideas I am having trouble narrowing it down. Does anyone have ideas of how I can look for internships in the sustainability field, and how I can make myself a stronger candidate while I’m still in school?

I am currently studying Energy Management &amp; Building Science at my local community college.

There are more but the overall theme is dealing with our energy needs as it applies to commercial and residential structures. I enjoy this material a great deal but the one thing I’m not finding is a focus on transportation. That is what I am really interested in and I would love to find a program where I could learn more about how to move goods and people from one place to another in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way.

eoesrt,1578969036,Working Towards Sustainability On a Larger Scale- What Are Three Things At Your Place of Work that Can Help Our Planet in 2020?,"When talking about sustainability and the fight to implement better practices, the focus is usually on our personal behavior and consumption at home. But, changing policy on a larger scale is without a doubt much more helpful in this fight. \n\nFor example, I work at a museum, in a very large facility of over 100,000 square feet. Most thankfully, we use geothermal energy as our main power source in the main exhibit hall, so our biggest source of energy use is already sustainable. HOWEVER! There are other huge uses of energy and consumption in my place of work, and I've been thinking a lot lately about what I can do in my position of influence in 2020 to make us more sustainable and beneficial to our planet. \n\nThere are a lot of factors to consider in how we operate, but the biggest factor is that I want to stay mindful of our mission to educate the public and increase accessibility. I am also a big advocate of utilizing sustainable practices that also decrease boring, tiresome work that often comes along with living in a consumption-driven society. So I'm thinking of things that meet all of these goals, for example:\n\n1. We have a gigantic, grass lawn that surrounds the museum that most be mowed be an employee every week on a gas-guzzling mower during the warm months, and it takes them hours to do it. We have almost no trees or plants in general across the lawn, it is the opposite of bio-diverse. My plan is to talk to my boss(the director) and then the maintenance employee that does the lawn-cutting to see if we can make a plan to add small trees, bushes or plants at agreed-upon locations when Spring begins. If they agree, I'll let them decide what is practical here. My vision is that we come up with a solution that adds biodiversity and decreases the amount of time that the employee has to spend cutting the lawn. It should be a win-win-win for everyone, including the staff and the public who can use the trees etc. as a refuge from the unbearably humid summer heat here in time. \n2. I work in a section of the museum that closes down 30 minutes before the rest of the building. We have about 40 spotlights in our area, that we usually do not turn off until we go home at closing. After closing up our section, I'm turning off the lights right away, and talking to the other 2 employees in my section about doing the same. The result is that 40 energy intense spotlights will be off an extra half hour every day(I'm roughly guessing the amount of lights we have is the same energy equivalent as 3 homes or so). \n3. The museum has dozens of glass and plexiglass exhibit cases that need regular cleaning. At this point, we have staff and volunteers using Windex in aerosol cans and paper towels to clean them. We have the ability to use cleaning products from a tap in the maintenance closet and cleaning tools that are reusable. I've started using them when I clean, but I will also be talking to my other co-workers who perform this task to see if they will agree to do the same. Less aerosol cans and paper towels thrown away in the dozens every month! \n\nBut this is just what I'm doing currently at my place of work. What are some things you can do at yours ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/eoesrt/working_towards_sustainability_on_a_larger_scale/

ensn4e,1578859849,Glitter Exchange Program Idea,"The other night, my friend had glitter on their face, and I asked if it was eco-friendly. They sighed and admitted that it was not and that they plan on buying eco-friendly glitter next time they re-up. I then recalled that I have a whole stash of evil plastic glitter that has been sitting in my room for almost two years (I'm very queer). That's when I realized a potentially serious problem.\n\nIf we tell people to stop using glitter right away, what happens to the glitter that has already been manufactured (sold and unsold)? Won't a glitter ban dump all of that glitter into landfills immediately whereas it normally would be discarded over time? A glitter ban may have serious immediate environmental consequences if we don't create a system to properly dispose of glitter that has already been created and potentially sold. That's why my brain came up with the glitter exchange program.\n\nSo to understand my idea, you should first know what casting resin is. It comes in liquid form; you pour it into a cast of any shape or size; and it hardens to become a highly durable, long-lasting, and beautiful *thing*. It can be used in many different applications, but for this let's focus on it's use in modern furnature. Oh and did I mention that some types of casting resin are eco-friendly?\n\nNow suppose there exists a company which specializes in making custom furnature out of casting resin. Then suppose we convinced that company to mix glitter into their resin to make a new, sparkly texture. The catch is that we use reclaimed and recycled non-eco-friendly glitter, like the stuff I have stockpiled in my bedroom.\n\nNext we set up a glitter exchange program where anyone can send us their unused evil glitter, and in exchange we send them a bottle of safe glitter (or perhaps partner with a glitter company to give the customer credit toward buying eco-friendly glitter). Since we would be buying glitter ourselves anyway to make the resin, the exchange program will have little impact on the actual material cost of the glitter-resin.\n\nSo at the end of the day, all the bad glitter gets cast into resin furniture, so we slow down the rate at which it gets released into the environment; and we fill the world with safe eco-friendly rainbow magic.\n\nLet me know if you think this idea is practical. I'm sure there are potential problems with it I'm not seeing. It might be something only a powerful CEO or government has the ability to pull off, but I don't know whose going to read this. So why not share my idea in hope that someone can save the planet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/ensn4e/glitter_exchange_program_idea/

And I want to do my part to reduce waste and my carbon footprint.\n\nBut how do you stay eco friendly and zero waste on a budget? The process all seems so daunting and expensive to me.\n\nA few things to know: \n1) My home consists of me, my husband, our 18m old, and a cat.\n2) I don’t have a washer &amp; dryer because I live in an apartment that supplies its own laundromat so cloth diapers aren’t an option\n3) I’m anemic and must eat some red meat because I cannot take supplements without getting really sick. I’ve tried to go vegetarian before and it made me so so sick. I am trying to implement less meat and dairy in my life.\n4) I live in a rural area and so I can’t really bike or walk anywhere.

el4zow,1578365199,The Change Is Near (read all),"The impending doom we’ve felt is a natural fight or flight response. Because the severity of it is real enough for us to realize it could mean the end to the comfortable lives as we know it. I agree in saying depression nor anxiety help the fight. The most you can do with such a division of the globe and high tensions world wide is to be kind to your neighbor. Lend a helping hand. Spread the word about climate change and ways to reduce your carbon footprint. Small changes do help of course even though the growth of garbage in landfills and the oceans don’t cease; it’ll still be less than if you didn’t make those conscious choices. \n\nI never asked for this chaotic life style of western civilization. I love the ability to have the ability to have a heated house, sleep in a warm bed, eat fruits and vegetables that don’t originate in this country, etc. But it’s a tough bargain. Without this kind of parasitic world, we would not know a kind and easy lifestyle. The kind of lifestyle we bear is also the very thing that keeps us weak and our minds feeble. Discomfort is where the ability to attain strength lies, comfort will make you soft bodied and even worse soft minded. \n\nIt’s all relative, it depends how you see it. But the facts remain true. We must keep spreading the word, waking people up and getting this world toward a more positive vibe. The old and still minded/ignorant humans will die off and the more educated, conscious ones will remain in their place to fix their mess. It’s all up to us to save our beautiful planet. \n\nI know, with some everyday is a new battle. You may lose some days, and I’m guilty. Do the best you can. If you’ve taken or are going to take anything from this passage, remember these few things: stay true to your beliefs, spread happiness and love, spread your true word. \n\nBe the change the world needs, it doesn’t need to be large. We are all but cells on the organism we call earth; if enough of us change for the better, the organism will too. \n\nAlso, most of the population is sick. Don’t follow the crowd, go against it. Don’t let yourself adjust to the sickness of society, for sickness is their norm. Be true to yourself even if you don’t know who you are. \n\nThis wasn’t just about the environment, in short it was about much more. The state of the Earth isn’t the only sickness that needs to be healed. Harness this moment, try to make the best of it.

It has a population of 68 million people that emit 6.5 tons of CO2 emissions per capita. That’s a total of 442 million tons of CO2 per year. At a cost of offset CO2 emissions of roughly 5 dollars per ton, the total cost to offset all CO2 emissions for UK individuals is only 2.2 billion dollars. Compare that to UK GDP of 2.62 trillion dollars, **the offset cost is less than 0.1% of GDP.** \n\nPut in terms of the individual, it **would cost the average Brit about 10 cents per day or $2.70 per month to offset their personal carbon emissions**.

To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.\n\nI try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.\n\nI define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.\n\nI’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.\n\nFeel free to share any of the material or repost this on other suitable subreddits.

We intend to launch widespread initiatives and online campaigns that will allow younger people to get more involved with the environment. \n\nBecause our vision is global in nature, we need people around the US and globally to help us with our early-stage growth. We're looking for people of various talents/skills (videomaking, graphic design, networking etc.) to establish a branch in their area, or if you don't have that much time on your hands, you can work remotely. Leadership positions are available but with the prereq of time commitment and dedication.\n\nSo far we have a few dozen members across different countries. We've conducted different projects like river cleanups, educational events, and our Portugal and India branches are currently collaborating on an air-quality monitoring device to be installed in the homes of New Delhi. We have lots of other ideas as well.\n\nThat was a general overview so if you’re interested or just want to know more, just DM me and we can talk from there!

What have you noticed could be improved on the medical side with regard to better processes, materials, and waste practices? \n\nFor anyone who's been a patient in a hospital, what are your insights? What problems have you seen, and do you have any suggestions for improvement? \n\nLastly if anyone has some starting points for educating myself about environmental science, I would greatly appreciate it.

e40puz,1575137388,Tickets for Trees - Buy one or gift someone - a Green Weekend after Black Friday.,"Hello Sustainability,\n\nFirst things First - **this is a genuine campaign, I can share my professional details with the forum admins.** This simple looking campaign is a culmination of 2+ years of research and digital nomad living.\n\n[https://www.eventbrite.com/e/79515588265/](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/79515588265/)\n\n**Please buy Tree and/or donation tickets**. You can choose to gift to some one. **Please spread it around** to achieve our shared goal of leaving a cleaner and greener playground for our future generations.\n\nAlso, THA**NN**OS is not THA**N**OS. The game/contest element is to introduce this character - mascot of our next global event. And to entertain and give back to the early supporters.\n\n**About** [our](https://betterself.today/) **mission:**\n\nThis event lays the foundation of **our core value - sustainability first and not an after thought. Invest in CSR, and give back (rewards!) from very first $ revenue**. And make day to day life fun, playful and rewarding for our users.\n\nOur team has taken an innovative approach to support established tree plantation NGO and our upcoming global sustainability campaigns - that will reduce daily CO2 footprint equivalent of Million+ trees. The attempt to combine contest with Tree fundraising is very deliberate and important foundation for the much bigger campaign. It is also important to keep a surprise element for upcoming campaign. I am happy to share the details with the admins.\n\n**About me:**\n\nGraduated from NYU, Led an AI team in California for 4 years, until 2017 end.\n\n2 years earlier, following intuition, I quit my well paying job as AI/Data Science lead in Silicon Valley. And through this journey I explored the top meaningful problems to solve for humanity. After connecting several dots, earlier this year I arrived at that sustainability/climate change is the biggest challenge facing whole humanity, it is way bigger challenge than most people realise. And we must act fast.\n\nTherefore, I have committed my rest of life on this cause. It has not been easy keep rejecting cushy job offers that kept coming all the time.\n\nWish you all best and hope to share lot of good news very soon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/e40puz/tickets_for_trees_buy_one_or_gift_someone_a_green/

e0chmz,1574480421,A self sustainable Reddit nation," \n\nHello all,\n\nI am here with my plan for my [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditNation/) Reddit Nation\n\nIf you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.\n\nI have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.\n\nObviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.\n\nNow here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)\n\n1. Acquire the island\n2. Set up the initial infrastructure  \n\n   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy  \n\n      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)\n      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.\n   2. Establishment of the Government Building  \n\n      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.\n      2. People will be made citizens at this location\n   3. Establishment of Civil Services  \n\n      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services\n   4. Establishment of a Port  \n\n      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.\n      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).\n      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.\n   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  \n\n      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.\n      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed\n   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  \n\n      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up\n3. Make the Island a desirable location  \n\n   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  \n\n      1. Free housing for citizens\n      2. Free healthcare for citizens\n      3. Free schooling and university for citizens\n   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  \n\n      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island\n      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city\n      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well\n   3. Make the island a banking haven  \n\n      1. Set up a bank on the island\n      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island\n      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island\n   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy\n   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  \n\n      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes\n      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well\n      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.\n4. Expand on the island infrastructure  \n\n   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets\n   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents\n   3. Establish schools and universities\n   4. Establish libraries\n   5. Establish Museums\n   6. Establish a healthcare system\n5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built\n\nNow for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding\n\nAccording to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000\n\n* The Island itself  \n\n   * 500,000\n* The Port  \n\n   * 200,000 to build  \n\n      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments\n   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  \n\n      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs\n* Initial Buildings  \n\n   * 1,000,000  \n\n      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.\n      * Buildings include\n* Civil Services  \n\n   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies\n   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs\n   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles\n* Bitcoin mining operation  \n\n   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company\n* Water Purification  \n\n   * 50,000\n* Food Supply  \n\n   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island\n   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan\n* Further development of the island  \n\n   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes\n\nNow in regards to how we will raise that sum\n\n* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  \n\n   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  \n\n      * Duke, Duchess.\n      * Marquess, Marchioness.\n      * Earl, Countess.\n      * Viscount, Viscountess.\n      * Baron, Baroness.\n* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  \n\n   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  \n\n      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.\n* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  \n\n   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  \n\n      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this\n   * Solar powered web hosting\n* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this\n\nIf you have made it this far, please join the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditNation/) for this plan\n\nMore information to come soon, thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/e0chmz/a_self_sustainable_reddit_nation/

They were able to bring down the energy cost to  1 GJ for 1 tonne of CO2 ( Most existing tech is in the range of 4-10 GJ).\n\nAlthough commercial scale up feasibility of the tech not tested yet, I took that energy cost as reference and calculated energy needed for CCS to absorb entire current emissions of US as a percentage of their current total energy consumption. For the calcs, I assumed 300 GJ per capita consumption, 330 million population and 5 billion tonnes of emissions. It turns out that to capture entire US emissions, CCS energy cost is only 5 percent of their current total energy consumption! ( 5 billion GJ out of 99 billion GJ) This number sounds too good to be true, am I missing anything?\n\nIf this number is true, US can easily allocate  5 percent of their annual energy cost to carbon capture. Maybe another 2-3 percent needed for pipelining and storage. I have been very skeptical of CCS, but now it looks very feasible with these numbers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/dypnj7/numbers_on_carbon_capture_tech/

Retailers that find ways to minimize food surpluses will reap financial rewards too.\n\n**Grocery retails of the future need to embrace innovation, and be agile with the implementation of it.** The grocery retail is a low-margin business facing disruption from the likes of [Amazon](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/amazon-to-open-its-first-non-whole-foods-grocery-store-in-2020/amp/). Sure, some of the grocers have launched their own [innovation labs/hubs](https://www.supermarketnews.com/online-retail/h-e-b-build-new-tech-innovation-lab), but the retail industry has now morphed into the tech industry, and it's now a race!\n\nWith 50% of consumers complaining that grocery stores haven’t figured out how to use technology like other retailers, according to a survey by [Phononic](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180220005044/en/Phononic-Survey-Reveals-Consumers%E2%80%99-Preferences-Grocery-%E2%80%9CStore), grocers around the world should be looking for ways to introduce cutting-edge technology and unconventional ways to improve consumer journey to purchase.\n\n[Wasteless](http://www.wasteless.com/), is doing just that; reducing food waste and saving consumers money, with the help of AI. \n\nThe startup created a turnkey, SaaS software solution, for supermarkets, to manage their stocks, and reduce food prices, as shelf life dwindles. The process inspires customers to take part in the war against food waste, while at the same time enjoying better prices, and an overall shopping experience.\n\nWasteless AI software allows customers to choose between the nearing expiration or fresher food, at different prices. If you are going to eat or cook the item today or tomorrow, why does it matter if it expires in 3 days or 10 days? And why shouldn't the price reflect this in realtime for a better shopping experience?\n\n \n\n![video](31y5ap2nzhz31)\n\n**Consumers are craving something different.** There are many reasons that consumers care about wasted food. Some prioritize the issue because of their feelings about health and the environment, and others just don’t like throwing money away. But concern about waste is everywhere. \n\n[**According to market research firm Nielsen:**](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/more-than-half-of-consumers-would-pay-more-for-sustainable-products-designed-to-be-reused-or-recycled-accenture-survey-finds.htm)\n\n* 83% of consumes thought it was important for companies to have environmental programs.\n\n[**According to CSB’s data:**](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/assets/documents/NYU%20Stern%20CSB%20Sustainable%20Share%20Index%E2%84%A2%202019.pdf)\n\n* Sustainability-marketed products outperformed their conventional counterparts.\n\nBy implementing Wasteless end-to-end solution, one Italian retailer [cut down waste levels by half, and increased product margins by 1.2 percentage points, boosting their brand image and keeping freshness at the optimal level.](https://www.wasteless.com/Bs.WebApp.Models.SuccessStories/1/document.pdf)\n\nWhether it’s through use of technology or finding creative ways to lure more shoppers to their store, it’s worth investing in solutions focused on food-waste reduction, and there is every reason to feed this ambition.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/dy870v/how_one_ai_startup_solves_food_waste_while/

People stopping to buy clothes is unlikely to happen, in the short term. And fashion can be an incredible tool for self-expression. My perspective is that fashion, in the same way as food, has incredible power to ground sustainability into practical terms for consumers. We all wear clothes, every day (or we should) and therefore it's around clothes that we can start an accessible conversation around sustainability. And, in the meantime, invest in researching and designing models for the industry that give back to the environment. What're your thoughts on this?

I'm currently applying to medical school but I'm unsure if my heart is truly in it, so I'm considering alternate routes. I have a BS in biochemistry with research experience in inorganic chemistry that I found to be so unpleasant I swore I would never attend grad school. Though my opinion on this is changing, I have no desire to do wet lab work in the future unless absolutely necessary.\n\nI have always been passionate about food and care deeply about the environment/animals. I would love to have a career that combines these interests, and it sounds like there are many opportunities out there in the engineering/ food science/ plant science world. I've looked into graduate programs at UC Davis and there are several that seem to fit my interests. Although I haven't completely teased out what it is I would like to do as a career, my main questions are:\n\n1) Does a well-paying, stable job in this field require further studies, and if so, MS or PhD? I'm someone that likes education and would (in an ideal world) like to be one of the leaders of a given concentration. \n\n2) Would pursuing a science degree or engineering degree be wiser?\n\n3) In your opinion, what is the general job outlook for sustainable careers?

Early next year I'll be going on holiday, and I have the choice of travelling by train (cost: about €300 return plus the cost of overnight accommodation both ways for about 40 hours of travel) or by plane (cost: about €60 return). \n\nObviously, I know that it's much better to go by train and reduce the carbon output in the first place than to fly and offset the carbon, and I know that ofsetting is far from perfect. \n\nBut what if I were to fly and not just offset the carbon cost of the flight (about 0.6 tonnes, when a tonne can be offset for about €3 on average on the UN carbon offset platform), but pour the entire difference between the cost of the plane ticket and the train ticket - so around €300 - into carbon offsets (worth up to about 100 tonnes, depending on the project)?\n\nI want to do what's best for the environment, so if that's taking a 40-hour train journey I'll just bring a good book and enjoy the scenery! But if I'm going to spend the money anyway, would I do more good by massively over-ofsetting?

dhmrlx,1571035299,Thanksgiving with my climate-denying conservative family,"Just had my \[Canadian\] Thanksgiving dinner. The first topic was that we need a Conservative government in this next election to 'get our country back on track'. The second topic was that 'birds in the forest won't mind the temperature being 2 degrees hotter', followed by 'climate change is the least of our worries while deforestation occurs' (said by my Harvard-educated uncle, a veterinarian..). Topic three was that 'electric cars are too risky because they can easily blow up, so we should keep developing gas-powered vehicles'. And all of this lead up to the 30 minute long conversation mocking Greta Thunberg: 'We stole your childhood? You look fine to me as you luxuriously travel the world.' \n\nI live in a very Green city where I'm doing my MSc on the effects of climate and landscape change on endangered mammal species, which made travelling home to experience tonight's conversations even more upsetting.

ddoh0e,1570288394,Advice needed for career change," Hi!\n\nRecently I quit my corporate job after a burn out and I decided to travel a bit with my savings and to gather my thoughts.\n\nI really want to start working for the good of the world and to be part of the solution, not the problem.\n\nAnd there are so many things that are wrong with our planet earth and with our society.\n\nFor the short term I am interested in freelancing. I need a break, so a limited project would be nice.\n\nIs it possible to freelance and to work from afar? Is someone from you a green freelancer?\n\nA bit about me and my background.\n\nI studied economics, more precisely: entrepreneurship, environmental economy, sustainability, econometrics, marketing and management. I have professional experience as an accountant for 3 years.\n\nI am good in business consulting and finance. I am developing my own holistic accounting now, based on taking into account sustainable impact and non-monetary factors. Impact measurement for sustainable projects is a big challenge.\n\nMy job doesn't have to be connected with sustainability per se, it's enough for me, if I find a job with a company who is green. \n\nOr research. I am good at that too. I like academics. I worked in the uni too. I have all the needed background for that. \n\nI haven't published anything yet, though. But I have been working on some stuff. \n\nI have no idea, where to start, really. Where to look for. What to look for.\n\nAny advice or sharing your experience will be most appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/ddoh0e/advice_needed_for_career_change/

d9f3m5,1569474568,"Tokyo's climate strike happened at 5pm, but at least it happened.","My friend and I happened to be in Tokyo during the climate strike and so we joined in theirs while we were there.  \nIt was pretty absurd at first because it happened at 5pm... Yes, a work/school strike that begins after work/school.\n\nOnce we got past the weirdness and joined in, it became immediately apparent that Japan didn't have a very large base of people that were particularly concerned about this. Of course, part of that might be the language/cultural barrier, which means they are more likely to organise their own protests than jump on the back of world protests, but I probably shouldn't have been too surprised. We were, after all, in a country where many things sold are triple-wrapped in plastic and then handed over in a plastic bag. Not to mention all the coffee shops we saw where all the customers were sitting indoors, drinking from disposable coffee cups.\n\nMind-you, as far as I'm aware, they do a good job with their CO2 emissions, so I'm probably focussing on the small issues. Also, I'm relatively new to understanding these issues, so I'm not the best person to pass judgement. Nevertheless, once it kicked off, a huge number of people joined in. It was by no means anywhere near the numbers seen in other countries around the world, but it certainly wasn't fruitless.\n\nIt was odd how we had to wait for traffic and it took a while for the politeness of the Japanese culture to wear off enough for the chants to get going, but once it did, the march was great! It gained quite a bit of attention and it turned out that we were marching through rush hour, going through one of the busiest crosswalks in Japan, in the city of Shibuya.\n\nWe made a video of our experience in the march here if you're interested to check it out:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTmwevYebyEI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTmwevYebyE)  \nIt's super interesting to see the change in atmosphere when the march properly kicks into gear.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/d9f3m5/tokyos_climate_strike_happened_at_5pm_but_at/

If EVP can do it, so can lawmakers. \n\nWhy voting is critical to the climate movement: [We need systemic change](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/06/03/climate-change-requires-collective-action-more-than-single-acts-column/1275965001/) (e.g. as the most recent IPCC report made clear, [pricing carbon is not optional](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf)) if we want any chance of meeting our targets, and as we've recently seen lawmakers who don't value the environment will act to dismantle existing environmental protection laws. \n\nHistorically, [climate change and the environment have ranked low on voters' priorities](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sites/default/files/2017-impact-report.pdf) ([because of low environmentalist turnout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U&amp;t=2m53s)) but [that is rapidly changing](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/green/A-Green-Wave-Signs-Point-to-Voters-Demanding-Action-on-Climate-Change-502796391.html), and [it](https://www.chron.com/business/energy/article/Cornyn-says-days-of-ignoring-climate-change-are-13848205.php)'s [sh](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/04062019/joe-biden-climate-change-plan-presidential-candidates-green-new-deal-clean-energy-obama)o[wi](http://time.com/4947960/lindsay-graham-climate-change-carbon-tax/)[ng](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/22/18691902/elizabeth-warren-2020-climate-change-policy-proposal-corruption) in [la](https://time.com/5659372/bernie-sanders-climate-plan/)w[ma](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4787637/sen-lamar-alexander-details-manhattan-project-clean-energy)k[er](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/fighting-the-political-winds)'s [re](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/4/20848059/pete-buttigieg-2020-climate-change-plan)s[po](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/15/garret-graves-republican-climate-change-louisiana)n[ses](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/politics/kamala-harris-climate-plan/index.html). \n\nVoting is critical to our success as a climate movement because [voter priorities predict lawmaker priorities](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00357.x). \n\nEVP turned out [58,961 eco-conscious voters who otherwise wouldn't have voted](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/climate-vote-2020-environmental-voter-project_n_5d689479e4b0488c0d12103e) (as determined by randomized controlled trial) and now [over 2,000 candidates for public office are vowing not to accept fossil fuel money](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/climate-vote-2020-environmental-voter-project_n_5d689479e4b0488c0d12103e). \n\nAnyone interested in volunteering with EVP at the \#ClimateStrike signing up Environmental Voters needs to get in touch with them by Wednesday (tomorrow) by 5:00 p.m. at the latest.\n\nhttps://www.environmentalvoter.org/get-involved",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/d5g1z9/if_youre_going_to_the_climatestrike_in_the_us/

d0i7q6,1567783903,Compromising with hygiene products,"Hello,\n\nA little background: I live in an Eastern(ish) EU member country. Beyond providing/using recycling bins the government nor the people are not really interested (generalising, I know) in living a life with less of an impact. As a result demand for sustainable products is lower which means that products I'm looking for are only available in a few select foreign online shops that happen to deliver to my tiny country. But the problem appears with the prices. I know since Reddit is mostly US/Western Europe based it may sound silly bit I genuinely cannot afford or at the very least I is very hard to justify buying a 8€ bar of soap wrapped in paper as opposed to buying bar soap from a giant corporation that costs 0.5€(also in a paper box, but most likely very unethical). The only affordable vegan bar soap I can find is wrapped in plastic. And when it comes to bar shampoos the prices are always 12€ or more which again is out of my price range.\n\n\nWhat I am trying to ask is your opinion about such trade-offs e.g.:\n - buying soap from a brand like Nivea (animal testing, likely fewer green policies as niche brands etc) or buying vegan but plastic wrapped soap\n - regular toothpaste but use it knowing that relative to ads a very small amount is enough or spending more than I would usually for a product like toothpaste tablets (regular toothpaste approx 3€; tablets 6.5€)\n\nI know when it comes to spending more it essentially boils down to how much I ""want it"" but I'd still like to hear your experiences when dealing with such stuff and how you make compromises when they need to be made.\n\nThanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/d0i7q6/compromising_with_hygiene_products/

cxx96j,1567267856,"Pittsburgh, PA: A Case Study Pt.5","Carolan states, “Yet it is more than just its links to pollution that makes transportation a fascinating subject for sociologist. We often think about transportation as a response to changes in society is organized. […] we drive because our urban environments require us to. Yet the data tell precisely the opposite story. Urban and community patterns have taken the shape they have because of available transportation systems. The car, for example, made certain patterns of urbanization possible- patterns that, not surprisingly are found today to be difficult to service under alternative transportation forms. Thus, although many urban environments leave us with little choice but to drive (Carolan 135).”\n \n​Pittsburgh Office of Sustainability proposes these solutions to alleviate the problems that transit causes within the city. On the home front, they recommend utilizing mass transit such as buses, the T, and other forms of public transportation to get to where you need to be going. Pittsburgh has many pre-automobile communities that enable people to walk to their desired designation. The way that businesses can be involved, as we have seen their large influence in the cities development is to encourage their workers to carpool to work. The city of Pittsburgh implemented an HOV lane, or a High Occupancy Vehicle Lane, or HOV Lane, is used to reduce congestion along Interstate 279, the Parkway North, by promoting ridesharing via carpooling. This reduces the amount of cars on the road, as a result of the suburban flight. Restrictions such as two people per car, motorcyclist, and buses are the only permitted vehicles to use this lane. It advocates for lower congestion that causes pollution, and less cars on the road. Lastly, Pittsburgh implemented a “Bike Pittsburgh” program that endorses people to get on bikes and out of their cars. By establishing bicycle friendly routes all across the Pittsburgh region, bicyclists are able to commute in a safe way. The ways that businesses can promote this healthy way of transportation and life is through providing bicycle racks, showers, and lockers to facilitate in their choice of eliminating emissions through riding a bike. “Free Ride Pittsburgh”, which is a program for people who cannot afford bicycles. They provide volunteers knowledge on how to repair bicycles, so you can earn a free one through the program. There can also be incentives provided by businesses for people who use mass transit or alternative forms of transportations. Rewarding people who carpool with better parking spots, providing bus tickets, or even advocating a “Bike to Work Month”, and distributing local bike routes to get to work. All of these are propositions made by Sustainable Pittsburgh to aid in improving transit and eliminating the negative consequences of transportation. It is done through people individually and businesses collectively.\n \n​Next, making buildings more efficient. In the developed world, fully 40 percent of carbon dioxide emissions come from heating, cooling, and powering buildings. Many countries have embarked on major efforts to better insulate buildings and install more modern and efficient heating and ventilation equipment. Energy savings could reach 30 percent or more. LEED is the Leadership in Energy and Environment Development. It is a green certification program that recognizes best-in-class building strategies and practices. This is something you can find many Pittsburgh innovative structures taking on as a staple. As I stated above, the David Lawerence Convention center implements many strategist to reduce this carbon dioxide emissions through utilizing natural ventilation and solar energy. Another example would be the new PNC building, which is actually rather fascinating. A majority of it comes down to energy use. The PNC building uses a double-skin façade. The double-skin facade is a system of building consisting of two skins, or facades, placed in such a way that air flows in the intermediate cavity. The ventilation of the cavity can be natural, fan supported or mechanical. When this ventilation is not in use, they implement other energy efficient ways to heat and cool the office, however, this technology is aimed to use 50% less energy than a typical office building. The tower’s roof collects heat from the sun to warm the building, and facilitate natural ventilation. During the summer and spring, the solar chimney pulls air and helps cool down the building. It all aids in not needing to frivolously waste energy and to keep the building at a comfortable temperature.\n \n​The building is also structured in such a way to utilize natural daylight. Pittsburgh Earth day states, “Specifically, ninety-two percent of The Tower’s office space receives direct sunlight. To ensure a healthy and productive work environment, The Tower features blinds that prevent glare, help control indoor temperature and ensure that employees have sufficient lighting at their workspace. With the assistance of automated controls, these blinds activate themselves depending on the amount of light entering the building. They automatically close when there is glare or a significant amount of sunlight and open when lighting conditions are ideal” (http://pittsburghearthday.org/pnc/). Much of the building was actually constructed with recycled parts. Approximately 93% of the construction waste went towards the building process, to be exact. Drywall was crushed to be used as lightweight board, and steel was melted and reused. The Near Zero Waste program recycles everything. This ranges from composting organic waste, such as food, to organizing bins for trash, recycling, shred, and compost. This is an aspect as to how local businesses can aid in the urban political economy for the better good: how interrelated the environment, growth of the city, and how building the city is physically formed and the sociological perspectives that it projects. PNC is a clear example of this. The sustainable objective that this infrastructure cultivates is an optimistic view sociologically for the cities inhabitants. It promotes a healthy and green outlook that is encouraged by a business.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/cxx96j/pittsburgh_pa_a_case_study_pt5/

cxousz,1567208826,"Pittsburgh,PA: A Case Study Pt 4","Pittsburgh, just like every other United State’s city, has characteristics from a “built environment”. This is another theoretical approach to explaining the demands for a sustainable city, or eco-city in the North Western Pennsylvania region. The demand for urban change in the city comes from the demands of the citizens, and is responded to, or not responded to by the private sectors or local governments. Kleniwski argues, “The human-environment interaction is reciprocal: people build cities to fulfill certain purposes, and once the cities are built, they influence how people live in them (11)”. Mass transit, new eco-friendly buildings, preservation of historical territories, upgrading power infrastructure, and boosting clean energy are all very critical when manifesting and cultivating a transition from a once heavily polluted area, into an up and coming sustainable space. A more specific example of this would be “The David L. Lawrence Convention Center is a significant symbol of the ""new"" Pittsburgh Region. As Pittsburgh continues to revolutionize into a regional destination place, this landmark building has become the cornerstone of the transformation (visitpittsburgh.com).” The convention center, located in Pittsburgh’s historical strip district is the world’s first “green” convention center, as well as the world’s largest “green” building. The David L. Lawrence Convention Center uses a reclamation water system that aids in reducing potable water usage, as well as, the building utilizes natural ventilation and daylight to cool and heat the building. The transition into a post-industrial society, which Pittsburgh has progressed into is a direct communication and correlation between the cities residents and private sectors developments. Kleniewski states, “A city’s built environment is a reflection of its social structure (12)”. This is highlighted and demonstrated through the changes in political and economic realm of Pittsburgh. As the city turns into a very technological and medical dominated area, the people who come to fulfill those jobs represent a more affluent and educated background. This sociological development of the cities urban residents pushes for better surroundings, and in turn, is reflected by the green establishments and changes the cities have produced to “work with nature”. This recent change represented the post-industrial outlook, and hopes to encompass all rights for equality.\n\n​Going back to the holistic theoretical approach of what urban cities can do to implement a progressive change; one must review how to make our cities more livable and sustainable, and analyze if our case study, Pittsburgh, is following suit in these actions. The political urban economy of a city is the driving force behind making these crucial developments. General changes that can be implemented into making Pittsburgh into a more sustainable city involve: improving mass transit, making buildings more efficient, preservation of historical and natural assests, and upgrading power infrastructure.\n \n​Improving mass transit is a necessity for sustainable cities, and something that Pittsburgh has been moving towards. Cities in the United States, such as Pittsburgh are designed in a grid-lock fashion. This grid-lock, or block to block road ways allows for the congregation of automobiles and for heavy waves of emissions and pollution to occur.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/cxousz/pittsburghpa_a_case_study_pt_4/

cwwa8h,1567054813,"Pittsburgh,PA: A Case Study Pt 3","So what is the motivation behind the urban growth? Theoretical framework explains this as, “These patterns do not just appear as coincidence; nor are they the product of universal laws of urban development. They are result of human actions, people who have motives, thoughts, and intentions of their own, apart from whatever force is behind the patterned outcome of their actions”(Kleniewski 86). There are three contributing factors to this process of urban growth and change: City builders, local government officials, and corporations. This poses to be a problem with developing a sustainable conscious city in the United States. City builders are property capitalist, who conduct their endeavors based off of the best intentions for their own business. These capitalist figure out the future demands of a region, and specialize in shaping space and reselling it as a commodity. Real estate developers play a large role in the production of a urban cities development. These real estate developers are often dictated by large corporations, and do not utilize the concept of “working with the environment, not against it”, in mind. They have capitalism dreams as a priority and neglect the repercussions of the infrastructures that they produce.\n \n​The next contributor is local government. The public sector of local governments must aid in development or create regulations of the private sector to produce a better more prosperous city. There cannot be more emphasis on how important it is for local governments to oversee their cities growth. Kleniewski states, “Through planning and zoning regulations, government agencies attempt to channel certain land uses into certain areas. (89)” In theory, this is a wonderful concept. However, as Kleniewski continues, is not typically implemented in the United States.” When analysts have examined cases of government involvement in urban development process, they have consistently found an underlying commitment of a business agenda. This can be because businesses influence politics and can determine who gets elected, because business leaders are often better organized and can articulate their desires more directly than can other citizens, or because public officials fear that businesses might leave the city if they do not have the favorable business climate they seek”. This conclusion is so profound when analyzing the structure of urban cities, such as Pittsburgh. Local governments are supposed to hold the best interest of the citizens of the city in mind when structuring development and regulations. As we can see, private sectors become a priority and blind side the better good, which would be producing a city that provides a better quality of life for their people. Lower class people, typically African American’s are unequally represented in lawmaking and city-planning, although they are the people who represent the region and have to live there. Corporations do what is best for their company, and neglect the needs and demands of the local people.\n​Another contributing factor deals with corporations and agglomerations. An agglomeration is a clustering of similar businesses, which foster their own financial districts within cities’ central business district. Kleniewski argues, “This concentration can produce an economic boom in an area that becomes the site of an emerging industry. Because companies in new industries typically have high rates of growth and profit, they create many jobs and spur population growth in the areas in which they locate. Conversely, communities or regions that contain large concentrations of mature industries are often vulnerable to companies decisions to cease operations” (90). This agglomeration explains the population growth, and the hierarchy and control of the community and cities structure. It does not adherently aid in better decision making for the environment, but acts in the internal interests of the company.\n \n​These three contributors: corporations, local governments, and city builders are all a part of a large scheme; being the perspective of urban political economy. Urban workers typically have three common themes. Those being, that their jobs are based on a specialized division of labor, are dominated by wage work, and channel this economic activity into specialized places designed directly for it. Political structures also play a large part when it comes to the perspective of urban political economy. Kleniwski states, “Thus, two of the most important aspects of urban life are the economic and political institutions. These two key institutional areas will be the lenses through which we will examine cities. Although we think of political processes and economic processes as distinct and separate, they are actually highly interrelated and are becoming even more intertwined (10)”. The political economic institution directly effects how a city is developed. This pertains to the way the city is physically formed, cultural norms, and social relations of the city.  In essence, how does the city shape social life? It does so through integrating and being affected by political and economic realms. It’s a conceptualization of social space and police, and the focus on the government’s part in shaping this environment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/cwwa8h/pittsburghpa_a_case_study_pt_3/

The environmental club and I are trying to change that, but it is currently not feasible to switch to reusable plates. Our dining service is severely understaffed so they use single-serve plastics to avoid washing dishes. Until our dining service has enough staff, they will continue to use plastic (which is understandable and we are trying to encourage people to work at the dining halls). \n\nSo we need to try something else, and we are thinking of biodegradable plates. Since those are expensive, our college will absolutely not pay for them. Is there a way to get funding for this, such as through a grant or sponsorship? We are a large state school in the US but if we asked for more money from the government they would just laugh in our face.

Hemp**\n\nHemp’s middle name is “versatile” because this sustainable fabric can be used for just about anything! From clothing, to food, to construction, to beauty products, it really does it all! \n\n**3. Recycled Cotton**\n\nEmphasis on “recycled”. Regular cotton is problematic due to its high water and chemical intake it takes to grow. Organic cotton is a tad better, but still is water intensive.\n\n**4. Recycled Polyester**\n\nWhile regular polyester is pretty unsustainable, and uses massive amounts of chemicals and water, recycled polyester uses PET, a chemical used to create polyester, to break down the material and repurpose it. \n\n**5. Tencel/Lyocell**\n\nOne of the hottest new sustainable fabrics on the market is Tencel Lyocell fibers. Tencel is created from wood pulp that comes from sustainable plantations. \n\n**6. Econyl**\n\nAlso a recycled sustainable fabric, [Econyl](https://www.econyl.com/) is made from fish nets, plastic, and waste fabric to create a yarn extremely similar to nylon.  \n\n[**(Source - IndieGetup)**](https://indiegetup.com/what-are-sustainable-fabrics/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/ctm8rz/heres_a_list_of_6_sustainable_fabrics_to_keep_an/

Which I am very excited about. I am extremely concerned about this area though, although there is still a lot of natural land, a LOT has been burnt and cleared for cattle farms and crops, some of them hardly even use the land after destroying the forests! I am spreading the message of eco-tourism here in hopes that the local farmers will start reforesting to attract more eco-tourism, the area has a bunch of plants and animal life that are only found in this area and I feel like if I don't do something relatively quickly, the forest are slowly going to get whipped out here and along with it all the endangered fauna and flora. \n\nThe only way I can think of doing this is by reforesting my own land and putting the ideas out there to the local farmers, and hey, if any of you want to help and do the same and buy some pasture lands and forest to turn into reserves or just to reforest please message me, land is very affordable here around 1000$ a hectare and can save a bunch of lives, or if you just want to come and help me plant some trees,  I truly don't know how I can do this on my own, or how to do this really, I am new to projects like this one and need advice from more experienced people that have pulled off projects like this in the past.\n\n Gracias :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/cphxdm/starting_a_reforestation_project_in_the_cloud/

I read that LED lightbulbs use significantly less energy and am thinking of replacing all our bulbs even before they break. I can't get over the idea of throwing something away before it's completely worn out.

cdd5ez,1563166632,Is sustainable fashion truly sustainable?,"Brands like MEC and Patagonia are the go-to hiking apparel for many folk. However, they have more recently become fashionable; it's now attractive and sexy to look like you're ready for a week-long camping trip at 3pm on a Monday, at least amongst my age group (early 20s) in British Columbia, Canada. The notion that high-quality clothing is sustainable somewhat relies on the consumer having to buy only one high-quality clothing article - if a jacket lasts 30 years, you only need one jacket and therefore consume less! But I worry that these sustainable brands will lose their reputation as *the* sustainable brands and perhaps diverge from their quest to reduce society's environmental impacts. If people are still buying a jacket a year, are these sustainable brands achieving their goals? In my mind, we should place more value on second-hand clothing, but I have not seen any clothing brands do this - of course for business reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre there any ironies within the sustainable-fashion industry that you think about, and how do you minimize your environmental impact in regards to clothing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/cdd5ez/is_sustainable_fashion_truly_sustainable/

cd163v,1563096740,Climate-friendly touring,"Hello r/sustainability!\n\nMy partner and I have been taking big steps in our lives to be as sustainable as we can. We’re in our 30’s with good incomes and no kids, so we have a lot of options. \n\nWe’ve been calculating our carbon footprint, and surprise, surprise it’s the flying for vacation that kills us. No amount of sustainable living helps with that so we decided to cut that out too. \n\nWe live in Copenhagen, Denmark, so we don’t need long-haul flights to tour a foreign country. 1200km one-way trip will take us to Paris, through Germany, Holland, Belgium and France. Quite the road trip, but the question is: how to travel?\n\nHere are the options I’ve looked into for that specific trip and their pros/cons:\n\nPlane - 252kg C02 - only takes 1.5 hours\n\nCar - 86kg C02 - Flexible trip and spacious\n\nMotorbike - 60kg C02 - Flexible trip and easy parking\n\nTrain - 51kg C02 - No driving and spacious\n\nCoach - 52kg C02 - No driving and cheap\n\nAll C02 calculations are averages from numerous sources (since the numbers can vary a lot per website) and are per person. \n\nIve also looked at electric options, which would be ideal, but it seems tricky. Electric motorbikes simply don’t have range enough (250km max?) and cars are still pretty limited by charging stations - although not impossible. \n\nAt this point I’m most interested in the motorbike option since that let’s us go anywhere and stop whenever we like. However I’ve read numerous sources that say motorbikes produce carbon monoxide and so are much worse for the environment than cars. A C02 calculator is simply not enough. \n\nI’ve also book an Interrail trip for August to try that out. We’ll be doing 4 days of travel in 10 days. Some sources put trains waaayyy down on the C02 footprint so it seems like a good idea but I don’t like having to go only where the trains can take me - and there are ALWAYS risk of delayed/cancelled trains and missed connections. Do I really want to spend all my vacation trying to catch trains? It’s also much much more expensive than flying. If I’d book a single ticket to Paris it would cost me at least 10x more than flying. Interrail is great value but it means only city hopping, not a one destination vacation. \n\nI’m so lost in this rabbit hole. Can anyone provide further insight or advice? Or if anyone feels like building me a 500km range motorbike that would be great.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/cd163v/climatefriendly_touring/

c7qphz,1561975217,A common misunderstanding which needs addressing : Tree planting and carbon,"You will often see comments regarding tree planting, as a solution for carbon removal, being criticized with a deep misunderstanding.\n\nThe criticism being thrown around is that the tree will release all the carbon back into the atmosphere once it decomposes and that growing trees is therefore not a valid way of permanently removing and storing carbon.  The follow up ideas are quite ridiculous. ""We need cut the trees down and bury them, deep in the earth, after they are grown""...etc\n\nThe idea with planting trees is to extend the existing forest biomes, and bring them closer to the original size they were before humans clear-cut them for lumber.   \n\nThe best way to think of it is that any square acre of forest always has a certain amount of organic life in it.  The forest canopy, the understorey, the shrub layer, the forest floor and the soil all store carbon.  When a tree,a shrub, or a mushroom die, they release carbon back into the atmosphere, but they also make space for more life.  You could say that a certain amount of carbon is always locked into the net cycle of life/lives within that square acre.  The same would not be true if it was a parking lot.\n\nOf course, it's not only about forests.  The same is true for all the different biomes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/c7qphz/a_common_misunderstanding_which_needs_addressing/

I thought about whether there was a way I could use a more environmentally friendly washing liquid. I realised that most powders come in boxes but liquids don’t. However I don’t really like powders (I share a laundry with people who use them and there’s always powder left in the machine). I thought “why can’t we just have dispensers for things at the stores, and they calculate how much you fill up your container as it fills and you could use that for all liquids and even cookies and lollies and potato chips can use them. And that way it’s got zero packaging instead of just better packaging. It would also reduce waste, with people only getting as much as they need, rather than getting more than they can use and throwing out the rest. Why hasn’t this been implemented in stores already? Do you know of anyone who could start working on it? I don’t really know where to start with an idea like this. Also I wanna know if any of you can see potential problems with the system. \nThanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/c6fhq4/an_idea_i_had_in_the_shower_why_isnt_it_already_a/

Currently I am working at an internship where I am learning the in-depth horrors of fracking and the industry. I always knew it was bad but had no idea how much the companies were destroying the people's lives and just how complacent the government is. On top of all that, the largest cracker plant is being build nearby and despite proof this will cause widespread health issues, everyone is just keeps saying it will bring jobs. It has seriously lead me to debate moving out of Pennsylvania.\n\nWhen I worked with animals it was hard to see neglect and know I couldn't save every animal. But being able to see the happy stories and give love to the animals in my care, it helped lift the dark cloud. \n\nHow do you keep sane when the world seems to be digging itself deeper and deeper into a pile of shit? People in my family and social circles are either oblivious, apathetic, or don't want to have to change their lifestyle. Some days I struggle to function I get so overwhelmed with dread (typing on the computer that is using electricity, likely generated from natural gas drilled from fracking...).\n\nSo how do you care without being crushed by the weight of what we are facing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/c5eov3/how_to_care_and_still_say_sane/

bzhw3n,1560285731,Question about Carbon Footprint and Powdered Drinks,"Hi All,\n\nI'm new to this subreddit, sorry in advance for my question. I'm wondering about the carbon footprint and other ecological implications of purchasing powdered beverages (""Tang,"" ""Kool-Aid,"" etc.) as opposed to juices that are stored and transported as liquids. It seemed like the energy costs of transporting and refrigerating/freezing liquid drinks would give them a higher impact/footprint, and that switching to powdered juice might be a good (and relatively easy) way for me to reduce my carbon footprint. That said, I know nothing about how this stuff is produced, and for all I know the process of creating powdered drink mixes is very destructive! I'm wondering if anyone has insights they can share, or if there are other factors I should consider in making this decision about my future grocery shopping.

The food industry is one of the most ecologically damaging industries and we will need to completely rethink its approach if we are to keep meals on the table for generations to come.  ""Food is the single biggest impact that humans have on nature. We are deforesting the earth to grow more food. It's by far the biggest user of fresh water, the single biggest source of carbon dioxide emissions, and the biggest reason why we're in the middle of the mass species extinction event, the sixth that planet Earth has faced. At least a third of the world's food is currently being wasted,"" says Tristram Stuart, food waste campaigner and author.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXkstU2HISw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXkstU2HISw)",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/bzdjyp/feeding_the_billions_a_new_frontier_for/

For example, in the food sector, if such a policy comes into play then the beef industry ( which has the highest  production footprint per unit mass) will pay its fair share of carbon tax. \n\nIf any of you  know academic studies done on this, I would like to read more on them.

Those that don’t focus on their material issues struggle to add value from their sustainability activities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Key Lesson #3: Set up the right organization to achieve your ambition:** Building sustainability into business units doubles an organization’s chance of profiting from its sustainability activities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Key Lesson #4: Explore business model innovation opportunities:** Nearly 50% of companies have changed their business models as a result of sustainability opportunities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Key Lesson #5: Develop a clear business case for sustainability:** While 60% of companies have a sustainability strategy, only 25% have developed a clear business case for their sustainability efforts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Key Lesson #6: Get the board of directors on board:** 86% of respondents agreed that boards should play a strong role in their company’s sustainability efforts, but only 48% say their CEOs are engaged, and fewer (30%) agreed that their sustainability efforts had strong board-level oversight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Key Lesson #7: Develop a compelling sustainability value-creation story for investors:** 75% of executives in investment companies think sustainability performance should be considered in investment decisions, but only 60% of corporate executives think investors care about sustainability performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom this same study it was found that 90% of companies say collaborations are necessary to succeed with sustainability. The survey respondents say the diversity and number of collaborations will continue to grow in the years ahead. Before 2000, 40% of companies surveyed had no collaborations on sustainability efforts, and 19% had just one to three collaborations. In 2014, they found that most companies were engaged in some form of sustainability collaboration and fully 16% of respondents said they expected to have more than 50 collaborations in the future.   \n\n\nWith these key findings it's abundantly clear that sustainability not only presents opportunities from a financial and sustainable standpoint, but also a relationship standpoint. There a numerous examples of companies that have worked together to create exceptional results. Partnerships can break down the traditional barriers of competition with brands looking to each other for support. Rivals such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo and Unilever and P&amp;G joined forces to develop more sustainable refrigeration, while in the Côte d’Ivoire a government-business initiative sees 12 of the world’s largest chocolate and cocoa companies, including Nestlé and Mars, working together to help farmers meet the growing demand for cocoa.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCollaboration is becoming easier and easier to facilitate on both a small and large scale. There are numerous global online networks designed specifically for collaboration. A couple of examples include [sustainabilityconnected.com](https://sustainabilityconnected.com) (primarily associated with helping organisations focussing on the Sustainable Development Goals), [www.commonobjective.co](https://www.commonobjective.co), (which has a focus on sustainable fashion supply chains), and even [https://www.bsr.org/en/colab](https://www.bsr.org/en/colab) (which has a focus on larger enterprise organisations).  \n\n\nWith the rise &amp; success of collaboration, the question is, are you thinking about collaboration in your organisation, and why?",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/bw844o/collaboration_for_sustainability_success/

bvx52w,1559480664,My opinion on 2040,"Due to the hype I went and watched 2040 today and I decided to pitch in my two cents. \n\nSpoiler alert, I guess. But it's technically a documentary and the only twist is that watching that movie makes you less likely to do your part in battling climate change. Funny, I know. \n\nBut I will elaborate. Let's start at the beginning.\n\nThe movie is about the father of a four year old girl who recognizes the whirlpool of shit our planet is currently struggling in and sets out to find current day technologies that could be benefitial for solving our collective issue(s). So far, so good.\n\nNow, I have to be honest, I am not quite sure what I expected when I went to see the movie. Properly researched facts maybe. Or an, at least implied, call to action. But I was dissappointed. And the more I think about the thing, the more it frustrates me. \n\nI will only go into as much detail as necessary. My main focus is on the message the movie sends.\n\n\nThe movie is split in several segments. In each, he discusses a (cluster of) technology and then simulates a 2040 future with that technology implemented.\n\nPart 1. Energy\n\nA village in Bangladesh has installed a solar power grid. A bottom-up solution by the people, for the people. Participants can trade electricity. A very good solution for developing countries that don't have proper infrastructure. And the people don't need the government to build power lines or other costly, well, infrastructure. I really like the idea.\n\nIn his 2040 future, the energy sharing thing is implemented in the area they live in.\n\nBut how does this connect to me, a citizen of the industrial world with functioning infrastructure? Sure, solar is more environmentally friendly than coal, gas or nuclear, but that isn't news.\n\nBriefly, the point of individual energy consumption is touched upon, but 'consume less energy and switch off the light when you don't need it' isn't exactly new either.\n\nSo, what does this segment tell me? Some people in Bangladesh have a solar grid now and bottom-up grids are good stuff. That's more or less it.\n\nPart 2. Transportation\n\nHe tests out a self driving car sharing thing (Not sure about the sharing part). He 'tests' it because he has to make sure it's safe. Bro, you walking into the road in front of a self driving car to see if it stops isn't testing. Google has been using the things for years. Autopilot is already available in private cars. There is actual evidence out there regarding the safety of that technology because it impacts us that much. None of this get's addressed, though. \n\nThey talk about how much emmissions and land use land vehicles are responsible for and then he shows a future of hardly any cars in cities and people commuting in driverless trams. Cool. \n\nYes, they say a car spends 96% of its time standing still. And then they leave it at that. That's such a great starting point for a discussion about how hard we need to question and change our current use of vehicles. But instead they paint a bright future in which -someone- has fixed it. Noice. \n\n\nPart 3. Food\n\nThis segment was the pinnacle of disappointment. \n\nThey discuss conventional agriculture and how it's bad. Main focus is meat, of which the consumption has to be reduced. Grain fed beef is bad, grazed beef is good. There is some additional technique involved: Planting a plethora of grasses and other plants as grazing land (as opposed to grain, I suppose, they stay unclear), which sequester a lot of carbon into the soil and into themselves as plant growth. And then you let cattle eat it because that's good for the environment. Let's forget that grass fed beef releases up to 4 times as much methane as grain fed beef (https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/4072/PDF), or that animal agriculture is responsible for 73% of deforestation (http://www.fao.org/docrep/012/i0680e/i0680e.pdf), or ... There are so many reasons why animal products are a climate killer. But eating a bit less red meat will fix it, rest assured. \n\nThe bright future he paints has a giant billboard which says that the average person eats 85 grams of meat a day. In 2040. It's ridiculous. That's it. No real further message. This is a disgrace, especially considering going vegan is the single most impactful contribution a person can make to save our planet (https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/veganism-environmental-impact-planet-reduced-plant-based-diet-humans-study-a8378631.html?amp\n\nhttps://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987). \n\nPart 4. Oceans\n\nNow, I am not quite sure if that was part of the food segment, but they spend a while on it, and it makes sense.\n\nMostly, they talk about a kelp farm that helps sequester carbon massively. The plant in question grows up to half a meter a day. Also it balances out the ocean environment and helps stabilizing it. Roughly, that's what they say. Obviously, fishing is part of the talk and we even get a close up of a panicky fish in a net. \n\nMy favourite bit from this part of the movie is a quote the loosely says that we are very reluctant to meddle with the ocean. Excuse me? We overfish the seas mercilessly, treat bycatch like garbage that just happens to pile up and drag our nets along the ocean floor to catch more. How is that not meddling? Now that we have to get our act together we are suddenly afraid of meddling? Shameful, this.\n\nAnyway, this kelp is pretty dope. But again, it ends there.\n\nThose are the segments. And the movie, more or less. In the end is a long shot of a Black Mirror-esque party with the grown up daughter dancing and all is good.\n\nIn the beginning I said I am convinced that this movie will make the watcher less likely to act toward battling climate change. Why is that?\n\nEven though there are some good concepts  the movie doesn't concretely talk about what I, the watcher, can do now. Today, as soon as I leave the cinema. But even worse, it doesn't even convey the point that I, the watcher, HAVE to do something, as soon as I leave the cinema. What it instead does is give me a good feelin about climate change, because -someone- will fix it for me. \n\nI don't have to take responsibility. \n\nThis is the message, and it is disgraceful. This movie, that is supposedly supposed to inspire me to act and do 'my 2040', just tells me ""It's cool, my dude, someone will fix it for you""\n\nAnd you know what? 2040 is far too far in the future. We need to get our act together now. Not hope for a bright future.\n\nI'd like to quote Greta Thunberg here:\n\n&gt; Adults keep saying: “We owe it to the young people to give them hope.” But I don’t want your hope. I don’t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act.\n\nThis is the sort of mentality we need. Not a movie lulling us into a false sense of safety.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/bvx52w/my_opinion_on_2040/

bubtmq,1559116372,"Zombie State Owned Enterprises, Vampiric Corporations, and a Fossil Fuel That Refuses to Die: Why India's Reliance on Coal is Bad For India and the World"," \n\nCoal in the United States is a dying industry. Coal mines in West Virginia and Wyoming have long been [closing](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/west-virginia/articles/2018-10-13/large-west-virginia-coal-mine-with-400-workers-closing) their doors, and total coal consumption in 2018 is close to half of what it [was ](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37692)a decade ago. It is likely the coal power plants will struggle to survive without [subsidies](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/06/06/donald-trump-hopes-to-save-americas-failing-coal-fired-power-plants). However, it would be a mistake to assume that coal is a dying industry. Many large countries, including India, Indonesia, and China are rapidly increasing their use of coal. In today's podcast episode, I will be exploring India's coal industry, focusing on the struggles of Coal India, the public sector enterprise that dominates coal mining, to dig up enough coal to meet India's demand, the inability of coal and other extractive industries to bring development to the regions where they are most active, and the implications of India's increasing use of coal on the global environment.\n\nCoal India Limited, a state controlled mining company that [controls ](https://www.coalindia.in/DesktopModules/DocumentList/documents/Annual_Report_&amp;_Accounts_2014-15_Deluxe_version_In_English_03102015.pdf)82% of the coal market, has dominated coal mining in India since its creation in 1971. Coal India has struggled to meet the demands of India's rapidly growing economy because it is expected to provide coal to power plants at costs well below global market levels. Coal India was forced to sell coal at prices 70% below market [averages](https://www.ft.com/content/9233696a-8323-11e1-9f9a-00144feab49a), reducing Coal India profits by half. Similarly, Coal India has long [subsidized ](https://www.brookings.edu/research/indian-railways-and-coal/)passengers on Indian Railways by paying above market rates to transport coal. Coal India is legally obligated to hire all of those its mines displace, and strong unions command wages that consume [half ](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/coal-india-high-wage-bills-cast-a-shadow-on-coal-majors-numbers/articleshow/13617713.cms?from=mdr)it revenues. Moreover, corruption and mismanagement at the highest level have resulted in windfall gains to connected companies of [$33 billion](https://saiindia.gov.in/english/home/our_products/audit_report/government_wise/union_audit/recent_reports/union_performance/2012_2013/Commercial/Report_No_7/Report_No_7.html) . A violent and powerful coal mafia has [emerged ](https://in.reuters.com/article/india-coal-jharkhand-dhanbad-coalindia/special-report-coal-mafia-stokes-indias-power-crisis-idINDEE94D00B20130514)that skims money off of each stage of coal production and distribution, with ""Goon taxes"" rising as [high ](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajes.12208)as 10%. The combination of these factors means that Coal India does not have nearly enough money to invest in mechanization and new technologies. Labor productivity of Indian miners is only 4% of that of those in the US, and only 1 in 10 mines are [mechanized](https://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/what-s-keeping-india-dark). The result are severe shortages in coal that act as a serious break on rapid [development](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/indian-govt-grapples-to-find-causes-of-coal-shortages-2018-11-26).\n\nA problem just as severe as Coal India's inability to produce enough coal for the Indian economy, is the fact that coal and other extractive industries have failed to bring prosperity and development to the regions in which they are concentrated. A vastly disproportionate share of India's coal reserves are located in the states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. These states are the home of around 8% of India's population, but [over ](http://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Energy%20Statistics%202019-finall.pdf)two thirds of India's coal reserves. India's iron ore, bauxite, and copper reserves are all disproportionately located in these [states](http://www.jsmdc.in/web/AvailabilityofMineralsinJharkhand.php). However, these three states are also among the poorest in India, with rates of GDP per capita, and human development metrics such as infant mortality substantially worse than the [national average](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/AnnualPublications.aspx?head=Handbook+of+Statistics+on+Indian+States&amp;fromdate=03%2F02%2F2019&amp;todate=03%2F04%2F2019). Moreover, despite wealth of natural resources, these states have seen substantially lower rates of growth than the national average.

While India is still taking [part ](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2017/jun/01/donald-trump-paris-climate-agreement-live-news)in the Paris Accords, it has made promises of only modest cuts because coal is so central to its development strategy. To be clear, India is investing massively in solar and wind power. Total installed capacity of wind power has more than [quadrupled ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_by_country)over the last decade in India, and 5.4% of India's electricity comes from solar power, a proportion more than [double ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_by_country)that of the United States.

Over the last decade India has grown only more dependent on coal, as the percent of electricity generated from coal increased [from ](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.COAL.ZS?locations=IN)66% to 75% between 2007 and 2015.

While per capita carbon emissions are well below the global average, carbon emissions are increasing at a rate over 6% a year. Reconciling India's need for development and environmental concerns will be vital for fighting global warming.\n\nIndia's coal industry is highly inefficient, a poor engine for raising standards of living, and dangerous to the planet. Nevertheless, the coal industry remains vital to the future of India's economy. Coal fueled the industrial revolution in 18th century England, the rise of America in the 19th century, and the spectacular growth of China in the 20th. Coal is likely to similarly, for better of for worse, likely to play the same role in the development of the Indian economy in the 21st century.\n\nSelected Sources:  \n[Coal in India Adjusting to Transition](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Tongia_and_Gross_2019_Coal_In_India_Adjusting_To_Transition.pdf) , Rahul Tongia, Samantha Gross  \n[The Coal Mine Mafia of India: A Mirror of Corporate Power](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajes.12208), Yugank Goyal  \nPoverty by Social, Religious &amp; Economic Groups in India and Its Largest States 1993-94 to 2011-12 , Arvind Panagiriya  \n[Targets of violence: evidence from India’s Naxalite conflict](https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01202689/document) , Oliver Vanden Eyden  \n[Carbon dioxide emissions from coal based power generation in India](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/44016368/Carbon_dioxide_emissions_from_coal_based20160322-12205-1ad56yc.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1557731198&amp;Signature=Q1AsvfQ0OaJnBpYDRsFAbauVQDY%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DCarbon_dioxide_emissions_from_coal_based.pdf) , Shiv Pratap Raghuvanshi \*, Avinash Chandra, Ashok Kumar Raghav  \n\n\n  \n[www.wealthofnationspodcast.com](https://www.wealthofnationspodcast.com)\n\n[http://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/India-Coal.mp3](http://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/India-Coal.mp3)",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/bubtmq/zombie_state_owned_enterprises_vampiric/

But that is why engineers have a Code of Ethics -- so that the detracted aspects of a design aren't a risk to public health.

bt8kn1,1558881177,"Unexpected new home build, looking to go NetZero [ON, Canada]","TL/DR: I have an insurance claim and it appears that my insurance company will be tearing down my house and giving me a settlement to rebuild. As an advocate for the environment and green energy I'm looking for ideas, concepts, or known practises to build a strong environmentally friendly house.\n\nTimeframe of events: In 1987 there was a permit to raise the cottage to add a basement. This permit was never closed. In 1989 the owner of the house added a second story and a new roof without a permit. The basement is now a finished basement, where no permit was pulled as required, and finally this is now a 4 season house which also should have had a permit.\n\nKnown issues: The foundation is undersized for the building, the main floor is out of plumb and level, and the remaining work is structurally suspect. The building envelope is completely failing (14.7 air changes an our based on a blower door test)\n\nWith all of these issues the only real option appears to be demolishing and starting from scratch.\n \nThe constraints: We are on a very small property, 50'x125' adjacent to a Lake. We are on a sloping property so our basement is a walkout. The current footprint of the house is 30'x22' (w x d). We do not have the room for a septic &amp; have poor water quality.\n\nThe proposed Solutions: \n\nThe house is located close to several cement plants and quarries. I believe this makes a concrete house the most sustainable and strongest option. I am leaning towards a 100% ICF house including floors and a flat roof.\n\nI would like a green roof so that I can take advantage of the views as well as reduced heating/ cooling costs. In addition the green roof will help reduce runoff to the lake.\n\nI would like to add an array of 10 solar panels to a small sloped roof to generate between 1kW and 2.5kW, depending on the quality of panel I can afford. I would also like 2 small windmills, which should generate 800W combined.\n\nI am thinking the best use of energy would be for me to run AC electrical for all standard receptacles and DC lines for all lighting.\n\nFor sewage I have looked into an Aerobic central composting toilet system which will essentially produce my fill for my lawn in the spring. I would also like to use a gray water re-use system, which can be used for lawn irrigation and car washing. (I can also use it for toilet flushing, but the toilets I have in mind use less that 1Liter per flush so that seems pointless to add into the plumbing.)\n\nFor water purification I am looking into nano-filtration, as I have hard water with high organics, iron, methane, sand, and high turbidity. This is why water Reuse is also so important. I am also considering copper plumbing for any drinking water sources and PEX for all others.\n\nFor cooling: I have been looking into mini split AC units. I have not looked into a suitable dehumidifier system yet.  I would like to also create a water jacket on the south facing walls to absorb solar heat before it gets into the house.\n\nFor Ventilation: I will need a heat recovery ventilator and would like to add a ground source air intake to help stabilize the new air introduced into the house.\n\nFor heating: I am thinking radiant heating is the best option due to the concrete floors. \n\nOther features: I am hoping to add a sunroom/ greenhouse as an air filter as well as humidifier in the winter. I want two kitchens, one designed for the heating season the other for cooling season.\n\nI am years ahead of when I hoped I would be able to build a sustainable house. I am in a bit of a panic trying to confirm the concepts I have planned, intersystem integration as well as exhausting all research sources. (I typically start with academic journals, Canadian approvals, provincial approvals, and finally municipal requirements to ensure my designs are acceptable.) However it has taken me just over 1 year to find a toilet system and building structure. I am running out of time researching everything else. \n\nHas anyone here ever attempted a project of this size? Has anyone every used or heard of any one of these systems or techniques?",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/bt8kn1/unexpected_new_home_build_looking_to_go_netzero/

brm5mj,1558513894,Should the CO2 footprint of employment factor into purchasing decisions of consumer goods?," If my employer pays me £80 per day, and I can estimate the CO2 footprint of doing my job, compared not working, is around 15Kg CO2e. So my earnings have a footprint equivalent to 180g CO2e per £. (This might be from my daily commute, chunky work computer, office AC and whatever it is that my company actually does)\n\nIf I wish to buy a new car, then electric is the low CO2 choice, but they cost upwards of £20,000 or £30,000 with finance. I would have to work loads to afford it, and so generate more employment CO2e, 5,400Kg CO2e.\n\nAlternatively a cheap secondhand car for £2,000 to £3,000 is more affordable, and although more polluting than an electric car, would only require ten times less employment CO2e 540Kg CO2e\n\nNow the electric car choice over a petrol car would reduce my personal CO2 emissions, but if the choice was for something that only marginally affects my personal CO2 emissions, like a mobile  phone or a laptop, then the CO2e from employment is more significant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/brm5mj/should_the_co2_footprint_of_employment_factor/

We have many different offices and depos around the country.

After a bit of effort I finally managed to get someone to give me permission to make a makeshift recycling bin, I have now put it in front of the general waste so that people have to look at the recycling bin before they through anything away. This seems to have been very successful and I am happy about my small success.\n\nHowever, this is only the tip of the iceberg, and in the same kitchen there are glasses and cups in the cupboard. There are also plastic 'disposable' cups on the side right next to the water cooler.\nI really want to change this but it means contacting the purchasing manager who works in the head office -the thought of doing this is quite scary to me.\nI have a 3 point plan\n1 - gather sources and info to explain the damage of the plastic cups to the environment\n2 - gather a list of names of people in my building who would like to see this change made\n3 - look for companies that provide safer alternatives\n\nI would then collect these documents and talk to the guy in head office and see if I can get him to make the change. (Bear in mind it took months for someone to let me cello tape a makeshift recycling label to a bin)\n\nHas anyone had any attempts doing something like this before, any tips or things I haven't thought of?\n Perhaps someone out there knows a special code that you whisper in a managers ear and then they instantly carry out the request? \n\nAny help is appreciated!

All will be necessary to pass carbon pricing legislation, but each volunteer is free to specialize in whichever area most interests them. Becoming an active member of this group [is the most important thing an individual can do on climate change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAW1A6Ca8), according to NASA climatologist and climate activist [Dr. James Hansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hansen). \n\n**So what exactly is Citizens’ Climate Lobby?**\n\nCCL is a non-profit, nonpartisan, grassroots advocacy organization focused on national policies to address climate change. Their goal is to pass legislation that immediately puts a price on carbon.\n\n**Why carbon pricing?**\n\nCarbon pricing [is widely accepted among experts](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/16/carbon-price-tax-cap) as an important tool to help [quickly reduce carbon emissions](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/remi-report/). Drawdown calls it “the single most impactful policy that would accelerate the adoption of every solution” in their ranked list of their top [100 solutions to solve climate change](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions). (src: [Drawdown FAQ question 5](https://www.drawdown.org/frequently-asked-questions)). \n\n**Will carbon pricing be enough to stop climate change?**\n\nCarbon pricing alone will not be enough, but it is a [necessary](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf) step in the right direction. More importantly, it is a step that we can take right now. CCL is the driving force behind [a bipartisan bill that has already been introduced in the US House of Representatives](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/763).\n\n**Is CCL only in the US?**\n\nCCL began in the US, but now has [chapters all over the world](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/chapters/) pushing for similar legislation in their countries.\n\n**Will CCL’s proposal interfere with the Green New Deal?**\n\nThere is no reason we know of that putting a price on carbon would interfere with the Green New Deal or any other future climate legislation. The GND is a broad resolution that is still a long way from becoming law. In the meantime, carbon pricing is a plan that may be able to succeed in a conservative political landscape and significantly slow down emissions while more comprehensive climate legislation is developed.\n\n**What if I disagree with parts of CCL’s bill?**\n\nAsk them about it! Their legislation has just recently been introduced, and will almost certainly undergo a lot of change. By joining in the conversation, you can express your detailed concerns to your representatives and help make sure that the final version is as effective as possible. The more people we have involved the more power we have over the legislation! \n\n**What do I do, exactly?**\n\n1.

bc6hi2,1555023954,Alternatives to Releasing Balloons,"I am currently a senior in high school, so graduation is, of course, coming up soon. Before that though, my school always has a ""Decision Day"" celebration for all of the seniors who are going to college, military, or trade schools the next year. At a school my size (about 2500 students) a significant number of students participate every year. My problem is that every year, each senior releases a balloon as a sort of finale/ symbol of moving on from high school. I'm hoping to talk to my school's principal, as well as the councilors and other administration, about environmentally friendly alternatives that we could implement instead, as well as research on the impact of balloon releases on the environment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo far, I've thought of a few alternative ideas:\n\n* Blowing bubbles, which is super fun, cost effective, and my personal favorite- my elementary class did this on the last day of fifth grade and everyone loved it.\n* Making or buying pinwheels (preferably biodegradable) and sticking them into the ground around the highschool's sign or in a grassy patch underneath a mural we made a year or so ago. This would look really pretty in the area, and be longer lasting than balloons, though not my favorite choice for reducing impact.\n* Planting flowers or something else around the sign. This one is unlikely because of how involved it is and the upkeep would fall upon the school. Perennials would make a neat legacy for my class though. \n* Rock Painting. I could set up a station with the help of some other arts students, and seniors could each choose a rock and paint it however they want. We could then use them to make a ""rock Garden"" or something similar. My art class did this with smooth river rocks last year, and we hid them in the neighborhood near my school as part of a public arts project. The process is super fun, unique to each person, and makes really cool memories. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd love it if anyone here could share any ideas with me, or link to credible research that I could use to make my case. I'm going to propose a vote within my class (those going to decision day, that is) so that everyone has input on the change. So any tips on presenting my case to the school would be helpful as well. I really want to make this change, and any help I can get would be great!",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/bc6hi2/alternatives_to_releasing_balloons/

I'm at a point in my life (27/f) where I need some career advice. I have a nonsense BA in Interdisciplinary Studies (couldn't make up my mind on a major + transferred 3 times), and about 2.5 years of experience with natural building (strawbale, earthbag, earthship. rammed earth) from working with various non profits (The Canelo Project, Earthship Academy) and private builders. I'm currently doing an Americorps service with Habitat for Humanity as a Construction Crew Leader and am working hard researching opportunities for post-service in July. So far, after attending Austin Energy's Green Building Conference, I've really been interested in how a city program and other independent organizations offer incentives to companies to build more sustainably. I love advocacy, although it seems really difficult to find an entry level position and even moreso one where you can earn a living wage. I really appreciate natural building but these jobs are few and far between. I have been looking into The US Green Building Council and trying to figure out which jobs I qualify for. I'm not opposed to going back for my Master's or some kind of certificate but at this point, I will more than likely have to wait until next year since most of the deadlines are gone. \n\nSorry for the long winded post, but all of this has been jumbled in my mind and came out like word vomit.

(Part I )," Imagine a product once it breaks you do not throw it away, but rather you transform it into a renewable nutrient or use it for an entirely new product. This is called circular economy, a model that does not have a lineal cycle of life and builds economic, natural, and social capital.   \nCircular economy is based on **three principles:**   \n\n\n* Design out waste and pollution.\n* Keep products and materials in use.\n* Regenerate natural systems.\n\n  \n   \n [***Ellen McArthur Foundation video***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCRKvDyyHmI)    \nCircular economy is an approach that allows companies to save on energy and expenses with a good analysis of the extraction, processing, use, reuse, and recycling, as well as design (ecodesign, biomimicry, and standardization) processes. Thus, with the right synergies, it can be used to **recirculate or renew components and materials**, and generate benefits for companies and the environment.   \n   \n [***Method of companies synergys Kalundborg.***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N5Kv7yfHxg)    \n   \nSynergy methods appeared based on the circular economy, and among them was the Cradle to Cradle, which proposes a not-so-academic biomimetic approach to the circular economy: In 2002, Braungart and William McDonough published a book called Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things, a manifesto that says, in the words of McDonough, “waste = food.” The model has been implemented by a number of [**companies, organizations and governments around the world.**](https://www.c2ccertified.org/)    \n\n\n## “We live with the unpredictable nature of the world, this one is more similar to a metabolism than a machine.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContinue reading:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://wikifactory.com/@mateo/stories/what-about-circular-economy-in-digital-fabrication-part-i](https://wikifactory.com/@mateo/stories/what-about-circular-economy-in-digital-fabrication-part-i)",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/b2h9xk/what_about_circular_economy_in_digital/

We did it! \n\nI am so proud of what we achieved as a team, as a collective of brands, as a community of change-makers and as a cohort of ethical fashion advocates. Never in my life have I worked so hard, been so sweaty and been so frazzled, yet utterly and deeply grateful for what took place on Saturday 2nd March. \n\nWe navigated a 38 degree day, we moved 40 seats with 10 minutes till the show to shade people, we changed floor plans on the day because AV equipment was shutting down in the heat, we ran out of ice *twice* because it was melting so quickly, 160 glasses went missing and guests had to recycle and reuse... But you know what? WE DID IT! \n\nEach and every person behind the scenes of IDENTITY dug deep and pushed through the blistering sun to make our shared dream a possibility, and I have no words for what that means to me. \n\nI forgot to thank some people on the night. I forgot some people’s names altogether. I didn’t even get a chance to talk to half the people there, but those who played a part in this momentous event, are superheroes. I got dressed 10 minutes before the show, no shower, no makeup, and I was hot and flustered beyond belief. But when I opened the 2019 IDENTITY runway in front of 400 people, I remembered exactly why I do this. \n\nThe pain in my legs from squatting and lifting and organising, disappeared. My shame in being seen by 400 people at an event that I ‘should’ have been fabulously put together and make-upped, disappeared. My extreme exhaustion faded away, and at that moment, I couldn’t have been prouder, happier, or more grateful. \n\nThis is what good fashion is all about. This is what a good community of amazing people can do when we work together for a common goal. We are changing the industry one outfit and one day at a time, and IDENTITY made an incredible impact. We’ve already had more than half a million impressions on social media and we've received raved reviews... Ethical fashion and sustainable design is here to stay, and we’ve proved it.\n\nFor Kiah Lucey's professional photography, head to our [**Facebook page**](https://www.facebook.com/FashionAdvocate/) and as always, shop local and buy ethically. \n\nThe Fashion Advocate x\n\n[Colour Coded](https://i.redd.it/c90m6j5pufk21.jpg)",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/axvgm1/the_fashion_advocates_2019_identity_runway/

Generally the soil in these areas are of poor quality and water for cropping is scarce so it’s economical to cultivate livestock in such areas. \n\nI’m all for animal welfare and as far as I’m aware in Australia many of our livestock farmers are held to the highest ethical standards and (in most cases) treat their animals with the utmost respect ensuring to the best of their ability that livestock are well protected from disease, attack, hunger and thirst as well as maintaining slaughter is fast and painless as possible. \n\nThough our nation will have to deal with feeding an increased population in the future and inevitably need to reduce our meat consumption as demand at current rates will outweigh supply, I’m just not sure about whether going vegan at this point in time is really worth it. \n\nWhat do you guys think?

In addition to pumped storage, it considers double-structure buffering, demand management, Norwegian hydro-dam buffering and international diversification via grid expansion. If Germany operated in autarchy and tried to handle the volatility of wind-solar production without using stores while replacing all nuclear and fossil fuel in power production, on average 61%, and at the margin 94%, of wind-solar production would have to be wasted, given the current level of other renewables. To avoid any waste, the wind-solar market share in an autarchic solution must not be expanded to more than 30%. By using Norway's hydro plants the share could be expanded to 36%. If Norway were to build all the pumped-storage plants the ESTORAGE study deems feasible, Germany's wind-solar market share could be expanded by another 24 percentage points to about 60%, which corresponds to 48% of the combined German and Norwegian markets. Additionally expanding the market to Switzerland, Austria and Denmark and building the maximal number of pumped stores would increase the combined wind-solar market share for all five countries to nearly 50%.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/aro72z/greenrenewable_infrastructure_in_urban_settings/

ao7ak0,1549566749,"""Lights-Out"" Pledge Sustainability Event Ideas?","Hello fellow earth lovers, I'm looking for some advice. I am a sustainability representative at my university and am working on planning an event for students to make them aware of the wasteful energy consumption that they could be enabling by forgetting to turn off their lights and electronics when they are not in a room.\n\nFor the event, I will be tabling and stopping students on the way to class to hopefully give them some quick information about wasteful energy consumption along with some type of pamphlet to further develop this information and for their future reference. They can then sign a ""Lights-Off"" pledge, demonstrating their commitment to decrease energy consumption by always making sure the lights are off when they leave the room. For students that sign the pledge, I will provide an aesthetically appealing decal that says something like ""Did you remember to turn off the lights?"" that they can place above their light switches as an incentive.\n\nCurrently, I am trying to think of more creative ways to motivate students to stop and take the pledge. I was wondering if anybody has ever put on or participated in an event similar to this? If you have, please let me know of any creative activities/incentives/demonstrations I could incorporate that can be related to energy consumption and preferably last no more than 3-5 minutes. I'm hoping to make this event a success by reaching and impacting as many students as possible!

anl1rk,1549414652,Xpost from r/gardening top comment that i think is relevant.,"The funny thing is, that's actually the healthy way to plant. Gardening rant - engage.\n\nWe think we need to obtain every single yield on our land - all for us and only us. The problem is that we depend on nature and the entire ecosystem to cycle water, nutrients, etc. If you looked at a 10 foot x 10 foot plot of land with a human on it, maybe a quadrillionth of 1 percent of the living mass on that plot is human (exaggeration alert - do not take literally). So why should the human get 100% of the yield? Hell, our bodies are only 43% human by cell count. The other 57% is symbiotic microbiology that lives inside us.\n\nI think having a paradigm shift in your thinking is very important to having a healthy sustainable garden (i.e. ecosystem). We tend to think very ""industrial agriculture"" in our backyard plots. Industrial agriculture is rife with problems.\n\nFor example, aphids take a tomato plant down? Awesome.\n\nWhat?\n\nYes, awesome. Leave them.\n\nWhy?\n\nIf you remove them, you remove the food for the ladybugs. How do you expect to ever have ladybugs if you systematically remove their food source? Isn't that kind of exactly what you would do if your mastermind plan was to sabotage them? Remove their food?\n\nWe need to think ""okay, that weak-ass tomato plant is getting donated to the aphids"". They are the lions attacking the weak gazelle.\n\nBut then I will have aphids everywhere?!!\n\nNo, you won't, and here's why.\n\nIf you remove the pests, you will have more pests. If you don't remove them, you will have fewer (provided they have a natural predator of course (screw you, Japanese beetle)).\n\nIf you remove the pest, good job. You just removed all the ladybug food. You are telling nature ""I've got this. I'm the ladybug"". Guess what happens? They already laid eggs, so you removed one generation of aphids. Now the next ones hatch and you have no predators, because YOU are the predator. So now you have aphids everywhere again. You remove them again. Next generation hatches, you have aphids everywhere again.\n\nNow, what if we have a paradigm shift in our thinking? Lets LEAVE them. Lets donate that plant to them - for the price of a healthy ecosystem.\n\nAphids cover that plant and threaten a few others. Ladybugs move in, because all your neighbours remove their aphids. Your land is the only foodsource for them all around. They see this ample aphid fiesta, and they lay eggs in your soil for their children to grow up on this ""fertile oasis"". You remove some of, but not all of the aphid infected plants.\n\nThe next generation of aphids hatch, but this time, they are met by the next generation of ladybugs - who solve the problem before it gets out of control. Sure you will see some aphids here and there. They will take down a few leaves on a plant. You may see a string of them crawling up the weakest tomato plant. But this is needed if you want balance. Balance doesn't mean eradication, it means balance. The price is one weak tomato plant. The benefit is an in-situ 24/7 garden security force.\n\nWe need to stop thinking we have ownership of every plant on our property. We need to be okay losing one or two, if it means we create a healthy ecosystem. Then we overplant to compensate for this. We plant in dense polycultures. We plant some wildflower patches. [We plant borders of perennial kale and clover for the rabbits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRJtg7rId9g&amp;list=PLWcGSYiimOLyrjnfvY5Fe7nqvQpZrkwG2&amp;index=5) so they don't eat our lettuce. [Here it is in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4fnoOnzMaU&amp;t=0s&amp;list=PLWcGSYiimOLyrjnfvY5Fe7nqvQpZrkwG2&amp;index=5). When we do this, we get the benefit from them (their fertility they leave behind), but we don't lose our prize crops. We put in bird baths so they don't drill holes in our tomatoes looking for water. They now instead drink from the bird bath, and the benefit for that small price is that they are now an enchanced garden security team. The SWAT team. They know we are their friend, and [they now land on our hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ-0dWydqsw&amp;t=0s&amp;list=PLWcGSYiimOLyrjnfvY5Fe7nqvQpZrkwG2&amp;index=3), and follow us around as we putter around the garden. They can sense we aren't adversarial, we are one of them. Part of the ecoystem.\n\nWe leave a wasp nest up if it's not in our direct walking path. Suddenly we find ourselves changing. We see a wasp and last year we thought ""stupid wasps, I hate wasps so much"", but now we find our enlightened selfs thinking:\n\n""*hello garden buddy. You are an asshole, but you are an indescriminant asshole. You are equally assholish to all things, including all my enemies. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Hello friend"".*\n\n(forgive the profanity, but this IS a rant after all).\n\n**Look at you, you are evolving infront of our very eyes.**\n\nAs soon as we stop treating our home garden like a capitalistic profit and greed-driven corporation, frothing at the mouth to maximize every single penny, steal from everyone and give back to nobody, take take take, kill this, kill that, eradicate this, grow in a dead sterile environment where all competition is stomped under our boot.... nature just doesn't work like that. And when we plant like that, we have systems requiring constant inputs. When we destroy something (say herbicide, pesticide, etc), then WE have to replace the function that those performed in the ecosystem. Or stuff dies.\n\nWhen we kill things, we create systems of inputs. Home depot won't mind selling you remedy after remedy for all the stuff you are killing and all the imbalance you are causing.\n\nLong rant, this is my passion - clearly. So ask yourself...\n\nWhat's worse? Losing a tomato plant here and there, but growing in a zero maintenance wild gardening permaculture ecosystem sustainable method? Or spending hundreds of dollars and growing that single $200 tomato that makes you quit gardening because it's ""so hard"".\n\nIt's not hard. We just make it hard.\n\nWe just need to realize, we're the small fry here. We're insignificant in the grandeur of nature and natural ecosystems. We need to sow our seeds, sow enough for everyone, leave some for nature, and harvest our modest share of it. But then we need to step back and remove ourselves from the equation and let nature sort it out.\n\nThat $200 tomato just became a free tomato, because you saved seeds. You aren't buying 10-10-10 fertilizer. You aren't spraying pesticide and neem oil. You aren't spend spend spend, input input input. You are composting, and mulching, and saving seeds. That's it.\n\nYou know what else? You aren't hate hate hate. You see aphids, but you no longer see ""AH PESTS!"", you see ""ahh... free ladybug food"". You are no longer having a high stress, negativity breeding adversarial relationship with nature. You are a mother fking hobbit. You are unshakable. You are at peace. You are serenity embodied.\n\nGardening now is saving and making you money, it's saving and feeding the ecosystem you live in. You are now a net positive force in the world, you are the sower of food, the bringer of life, you have risen and evolved. You are no longer the bringer of death.\n\nYou just need to take that one small step in realizing... ***this isn't all yours.***",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/anl1rk/xpost_from_rgardening_top_comment_that_i_think_is/

am50hp,1549045122,Need help planning Earth Day event-Please help!," \n\nHi all!\n\nI work in events for a local newspaper and would love to pitch an event for Earth Day. We do not have the funds for one so I would have to find sponsors or provide a seminar or panel of speakers. I would much rather have an event full of music, demonstrations, fun crafts, and other activities to make learning more engaging. I am wondering if someone here could help me brainstorm some ideas to help our Earth and those living on it.\n\nSome general and topic ideas:\n\nRecycling: Invite local waste management to discuss proper recycling methods and provide statistics.\n\nComposting: Invite local garden center to demonstrate composting and, if possible, create a workshop where people can create their own composting systems.\n\nDiet: Provide statistics on how diet change can not only help the environment but also one's health.\n\nLifestyle and zero/minimal waste: Instruct simple lifestyle changes to produce less waste to not only help the environment, but to also improve one's own health-mind,body, and soul. Educate about refusing and reusing.\n\nInvite instructor to do yoga/meditation, free to the public.\n\nInvite local artists to play acoustics\n\nWork with local forest preserve to discuss invasive species and the importance of biodiversity and protection of local preserves. I also think this would be an ideal place to host such an event.\n\nInvite vendors that showcase green practices. I would like to invite food vendors that promote sustainable packaging and vegan products.\n\nPartner with local garden center to pass out pollinator friendly kits.\n\nAny ideas or inspirations from what I've mentioned would be very much appreciated! I apologize if this isn't the right sub for this kind post and would love any suggestions for other subs that would be suitable for it.\n\nI also posted this on r/vegan and /u/KhaoticKlit thought both subs could join forces to plan something together. I'm completely open to ideas.  \n\nThank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/am50hp/need_help_planning_earth_day_eventplease_help/

airl7n,1548191427,Eating Vegetarian,"With more and more evidence about meat's carbon footprint coming into public consciousness, I thought it could be useful to discuss some general principles for eating vegetarian. If it's something you have never done before, it can be quite daunting, but it's totally possible (and delicious).\n\nIf you're switching to being vegetarian, you can't just cut meat out of your normal meals and expect things to go well. There is nutrition that your body needs that you are getting from meat, so you'll need to look at your diet as a whole.\n\nThe primary nutrition coming from meat is protein, but luckily, protein is everywhere in the plant world as well! Cultures all over the world combine beans and grains to get a flavorful delivery of protein (and carbohydrates) they need in their diets. Quinoa is an interesting grain because it is high in protein and carbohydrates all in one package. Nuts can also be another great source of protein. Eggs and dairy can be good, but they also have serious carbon footprint problems, so minimizing their place in your diet is advisable.\n\nProcessed plant proteins in fake meat products are also a meat replacement option. These often still have a rather large carbon footprint, and if you read the ingredients of many brands you'll find they often contain things you don't want to eat regularly. While I do enjoy a veggie burger, I've found that my favorite meals don't replace meat with fake meats, but are designed to be vegetarian in the first place.\n\nIron is another nutritional component that meat provides, but it is also easy to get other ways. Many foods you may not expect have plenty of iron. Leafy greens are a fantastic source and go well with almost anything, especially on the side. Raisins are also good, and easy to cook with or just munch on as a snack. Not all iron has to come directly from our food though. Cooking in cast iron introduces a good amount of iron to the food cooked in it.\n\nOmega 3s are one of the hardest things to come by without eating meat. They typically come from fish, and eggs, but if you're cutting those out, your next best bet is flax seeds. Make sure you break the casing of the seeds (mash, chop, blend, chew really well, or heat till they crack), otherwise they don't always digest and may pass right through without any of their goodness getting into your body.\n\nThere are a ton of side benefits of eating vegetarian. Your kitchen doesn't have a constant influx of bacteria that live in animals so sanitation is less crucial. Vegetables are largely water, so you can often eat more without gaining weight. The fiber in your diet will probably increase, generally helping digestion and reducing risks for cancer. Plant based fats are not as bad for your cholesterol. Generally, you end up more aware of what you are putting in your body and how it impacts you.\n\nAs a lifelong vegetarian raised in the south, I've had plenty of practice trying to eat vegetarian in a culture that is unsupportive, and even hostile at times. There are challenges, but it's getting easier all the time, and the more people do it, the easier it will get.\n\nPlease share your own tips and findings to help anyone thinking of reducing the meat in their diet.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a nutritionist or medical professional of any kind.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/airl7n/eating_vegetarian/

I'm all for tidying up your life, but my heart can't help but sink tremendously when I watch the hundreds of bags of clutter go straight to the landfill during her Netflix series. \n\nPart of why it's so hard for me to declutter is because I have to find a sustainable end to everything I own. Tattered, worn out clothes? Hoard them all for years until I have a pile big enough to take for textiles recycling. Styrofoam or soft plastics? Stockpiled in my storage room until it's time to visit the recycling depot. Other miscellaneous items? Post them on the ""free"" section of Craigslist so someone else can put them to good use.\n\nI find the amount of waste produced from the KonMari method a bit disheartening and problematic.

af5vrw,1547285346,‘Cement’ing endeavours is a must for ‘Sustainable Construction’," \n\nTHE term ‘Sustainable Construction’ emerges very often during usual Sustainability conversation but this key concept despite being the cornerstone for green infrastructure has not gained as much importance as it was anticipated. With fast growing urbanisation across India, the building activities have been witnessing rapid growth momentum, so does the strain on the finite natural resources.\n\nIt is true that expanding urban boundaries have also opened up better opportunities and promising future, thus further driving migration of rural communities to semi or urban cities, but at the same time the unplanned cities have been, it is a proven fact, increasingly triggering environmental degradation. The forest cover has been pruned or compromised while animals inhibited by toxic substances, vehicles and the loss of habitat and food sources…\n\nTherefore, mounting voices all over the country have been demanding immediate corrective actions as well as implementation of more effective long-term policies in this transition to a low-carbon economy, strongly backed by the determined lawmakers as well as big corporations that wield immense money power and have their footprints in remote locations. The later can significantly influence communities around their operations. In addition, robust guidelines by the prominently recognised institutions like NITI Aayog in India as well as the United Nations and World Sustainable Development Associations in the global level will give impetus to undertake adequate remedial measures that safeguard Mother Earth from facing catastrophes like the one that caused destruction in Kerala – the biggest ever in the recent history of God’s own state.\n\nTo proactively preserve the environment from gradual degradation, a significant role is being played by the building material sector – along with other core industries – by doing whatever possible. However, this industry and its allied sectors like real estate have been criticised as among the greenhouse polluters. For instance, the country’s apex court Supreme Court has, in its recent interim order, has imposed a ban on construction activities in three biggest markets – Madhya Pradesh, Maharshtra and Uttarakhand – over the delayed framework by the state governments over solid waste management. While this has sparked much turbulence in the relevant sectors, fortunately it was lifted within days. Furthermore, recently the Delhi government too took cognisance of severe environmental impact on the national capital, partly blaming the construction activities.\n\nThe environment researchers reiterate the planet’s health will deteriorate even further unless a stronger platform for dialogue and collective action is not brought to the forefront to leverage existing capabilities, that too on a larger scope and scale. The efforts in this direction will accelerate low carbon transition at the time when the government is spending hugely in infrastructure projects – Housing for All, Smart Cities, Highways and Roads among others.\n\nTherefore, much emphasis is given to the resilient green infrastructure that effectively addresses socioeconomic and environmental challenges by integrating holistic approaches leading to a conducive environment where economic indicators, social equity, consumption of energy and natural resources, and rapid advancements in technology thrive together. Emulating practices of global smart cities – Tokyo, Toronto, Seoul, Hong Kong, Amsterdam among others – is a good idea.\n\nBut over the years, the building material suppliers – particularly cement sector – have strictly adhered to and embodied the globally benchmarked Sustainable Practices that drove the Sustainable Construction, which has, as a result, been gaining momentum to promote and support green buildings that focused on mitigating both usage of natural resources as well as Green House Gases’ emissions. Their presence in rural and semi-urban regions owing to their nature of business has transformed the surroundings around its operations, generating livelihood and preserving the natural environment while balancing the sustained growth. In fact, India is among the countries that are on track to achieve the targets set to address climate change under the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe sector is adopting various practices to address alarming climate change issue – from innovative manufacturing processes that include optimising the extracted key ingredient limestone, advanced kiln mechanism, to energy utilisation and producing blended cement to offering value-added services including advanced concrete curing methodology and innovative rainwater harvesting solutions among others. Extending their efforts in this endeavours are the building architectures who are designing techniques including natural ventilation, double-paned windows, low-flow toilets and low-water-use landscaping etc – all enabling comfortable and improved inhabitants’ lives.\n\nThis gradual transition towards green and eco-friendly operations should be encouraged through a range of incentives, including tax breaks, or the prestigious certificates by the government. Involving a diverse set of stakeholders by the government to help improve sustainability scores while enhancing the value creation to the end users, besides enhancing awareness among all will surely deliver desired outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, the low-carbon transition is a continuous journey. Mere implementation of the latest processes, technologies and government reforms may not completely minimise the scale and impact of climate change. However, things can be transformed gradually only by collective and sustained efforts towards climate-resilient emissions’ control strategies.\n\nLink : [https://theinsightblogsite.wordpress.com/2018/10/09/cementing-endeavours-for-sustainable-construction/](https://theinsightblogsite.wordpress.com/2018/10/09/cementing-endeavours-for-sustainable-construction/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/af5vrw/cementing_endeavours_is_a_must_for_sustainable/

I don't see it and I think it's a buzzword that will be dead in 10 years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What are your thoughts on Zero Waste? Is there a private sector option for that? Or is this a government-lead venture that we'll need the private sector to be legislated into. I'm here to learn - no wrong opinions.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an example, during the year we'd work with companies that would, e.g. do microgrid as a service, but we could work with engineering firms that show up for the construction/project/etc. At this conference we would consider them a target audience.

a9p0jt,1545834908,Delhi Can't Breathe: Why Do Indian City's Have the Most Polluted Air on the World?," Every winter, the air of Delhi becomes an unbreathable morass. By some estimates, breathing one day of Delhi air when air quality is at it's worst is equivalent to smoking 44 cigarettes and the toxic air reduces life expectancy by approximately six years. The burden of air pollution falls especially hard on the elderly and infirm, and an entire generation is growing up breathing suffocating levels of pollution. According to the World Health Organization, Delhi is the most highly polluted megacity in the world, and three of the ten most polluted cities in the world are in the neighborhood of Delhi. In today's podcast episode, I discuss the agricultural origins of air pollution in Delhi, I discuss the non-agricultural sources of pollution, and the environmental Kuznets curve.\n\nIn a previous podcast episode, I discussed the [environmental ramifications](https://wealthofnationspodcast.com/the-rice-of-wrath-how-obscure-british-land-law-and-free-electricity-created-economic-stagnation-and-environmental-disaster-in-punjab/) of the green revolution.  One that I did not discuss was the air pollution created by the burning of rice stubble after the harvest. Modern mechanized harvesters leave a large amount of rice straw that needs to cleared before the planting of the winter wheat crop. The cheapest and fastest method to clear the fields is to burn to rice straw,  and more than 2 million farmers burn 23 million tons of rice residue over 80,000 sq km of farmland resulting in massive fires. As much as a third of the air pollution comes from these fires. Although the government has banned burning rice residue, the state governments have struggled to do so. For one thing, government policies such as [enforced sowing](https://www.pressreader.com/india/the-times-of-india-new-delhi-edition/20181020/281663960984871) times and large subsidies of mechanized harvesters only encourages more burning. The government has provided subsidies of 80% for the purchase of mulchers that process rice, but it is a slower process that costs 3 times more than burning the fields after subsidies are taken into account.\n\nMany of the sources of air pollution come much closer to the city of Delhi. India is a major importer of Petroleum Coke, a by-product of refining heavy oils such as those produced in Canadian tar sands and emits twice as much sulfur as coal making it one of the most polluting sources of energy. The Indian government has announced a partial ban on the import of [petcoke](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/why-is-pet-coke-still-being-used-in-city-asks-hc/articleshow/67169254.cms) for 2018, although certain industries are exempt. Similarly, the rapid growth of diesel car use has had a strongly negative impact on air quality. The number of cars in Delhi has more than tripled over the last 8 years.  Moreover, between 2004 and 2014 the percent of cars sold in India that used diesel went up from one quarter of all cars to one half.  In 2014, the government of India phased diesel subsidies out, and demand for diesel cars has collapsed. Only 23% of all cars sold in 2018 are expected to be diesel. Finally, coal, the only natural resource India has ample reserves of, is a major contributor to air pollution. There are over a dozen thermal coal power plants surrounding Delhi and the largest Badarpur, had long been falsifying records on emissions to pass standards. The Badarpur powerplant, and many others are being [phased out](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/badarpur-thermal-plant-shut-for-good/articleshow/66228551.cms) to help reduce levels of air pollution.\n\nOne of the most important ideas for understanding air pollution in Delhi is the environmental Kuznets curve. The idea of the Kuznets curve is that levels of air pollution are lowest in low and high income countries, but much higher in middle income countries. India's rapid economic growth means it is rapidly approaching middle economic status has resulted in a massive increase in pollution. Many cities in the developed word such as Pittsburgh and Manchester were once famous for being the types of places where a person could go to work in a white shirt and come back in a gray one. It is a process we have seen in Beijing, which for a long time was considered the most polluted city in the world. However [since 2013](https://www.who.int/airpollution/data/cities/en/), Beijing and the Chinese national government has placed draconian measures to curb pollution. Coal use was cut by one half since 2013, and major construction and steel projects mothballed. Levels of air pollution are down by 20% since 2013. The experience of Beijing shows that the Kuznets curve isn't a natural inevitability, but the result of sustained changes in policy.\n\nSources:\n\n[Economic growth and **environmental** degradation: the **environmental Kuznets curve** and sustainable development ;   ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305750X96000320)David Stern, Michael Common, Edward Barbier\n\n[Off Target: Status of Thermal Power Plants in Delhi NCR ; Centre for Science and Environment](http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/files/file/Off-Target---Status-of-Power-Stations-Report.pdf)",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/a9p0jt/delhi_cant_breathe_why_do_indian_citys_have_the/

So I was thinking of helping out by printing out (on recycled paper) a number of business cards with ways people could conserve water, then deliver them to mailboxes as a way to promote behavioural change within my neighbourhood. (business cards are cheaper than brochures, and can put them on a fridge)\n\nThe current draft business card has:\n\nOn one side: The slogan ""Conserve water this summer! It's the kiwi way!"" then a series of questions which ask the person whether using water is really necessary - ie ""does your lawns really need to be green/ water running to brush your teeth?"" etc\n\nThe other side would just have ""*City Name*, The Model Green City""\n\nWould this work to help conserve water? I presume having the sustainability questions in the back of your mind would change people's behaviour.

a6chc7,1544849876,"Is One Country's Trash, Another Country's Treasure: What Happened When China Banned the Import of Waste Plastic?"," Since 1950, the word has produced 8.3 billion tons of plastic, and 322 million in 2015 alone. Plastic utensils and other waste is filling up our landfills and choking our oceans. Plastic can only be properly recycled after being sorted and graded, a labor intensive process that most wealthy consumers are unwilling to do. As a result, tens of millions of tons of plastic waste are exported to China where this plastic is recycled and re-purposed. The plastic recycling may have solved environmental problems in wealthy nations, but created new ones in China. The plastic imported  that could not be recycled was often dumped into China's streets and rivers, and between 10-15% of China's plastic waste originated in the developed world. Moreover, the acrid fumes and toxic by-products of plastic recycling damage the environment. Wen'an, the city at the center of China's plastic recycling industry, is one of the most polluted in China. To solve these problems, China effectively banned the import of plastic waste in 2017, creating a host of problems for the rest of the world.\n\nIt is estimated that 111 million tons of plastic worth $ 7 billion  need to be redirected to make up for the loss of Chinese markets, and over three quarters of world's plastic waste exports once went to China . Some of this plastic was redirected to other markets, although it is unlikely any set of countries can replace the central role placed by China. Imports of plastic waste to Indonesia have increased by 56%, doubled to Vietnam, and increased 10 fold in Thailand. Malaysia has emerged as the largest importer of plastic, importing an estimated 160 million tons of plastic waste, more than any other country in the world. However, the same environmental problems of recycling plastic has overwhelmed these countries. Malaysia and Thailand will ban the import of plastic by 2021, and it is likely over time other countries will follow suit. Much of the plastic once sent to China is accumulating in warehouses and recycling centers in wealthy nations, and no one knows what to do with it.  \n\nThe Chinese government banned the import of waste paper in addition to waste plastic. The economics of paper recycling are similar to that of plastic. China once imported $5 billion worth of waste paper, roughly half of the world's total.  However, unlike with plastic, India is increasingly replacing China in waste paper imports. Indian imports of waste paper have doubled since 2007, and thanks to China's ban, are expected to more than double in 2018. Much of the labor intensive process of sorting and grading waste paper happens in the slums of Indian cities where wages are low, and environmental standards lower. The most famous slum based recycling center is that of Dharavi, made famous by the movie Slumdog Millionaire, but it is hardly the only such recycling hub in India. After grading and sorting, the paper is sent to paper mills where it is converted into newspapers and packaging. It is expected that by 2025, two thirds of all the paper mill feed-stock will come from recycled sources, much of this imported from abroad. \n\n**Selected Sources**  \n[The Chinese import ban and its impact on global plastic waste trade](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/6/eaat0131.full%EF%BB%BF)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[www.wealthofnationspodcast.com](https://www.wealthofnationspodcast.com/)\n\n[http://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/India\_-\_Dharavi.mp3](http://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/India_-_Dharavi.mp3)",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/a6chc7/is_one_countrys_trash_another_countrys_treasure/

a37vwe,1543977494,Vermont Sail Freight Project Reboot,"All,\n\n    I'm entering a sustainability Master's program next year, and I've also got a background of 15 years working in Museums. I'd like your thoughts on resurrecting the idea of The Vermont Sail Freight Project, since I'll be in the general area.\n\nAs a logistical preface, the project would need about 100-120 thousand dollars (US) per year to function with a full time, year-round captain. I've gotten this from previous correspondence with the original people who started the project back about five years ago. The barge Ceres is available for purchase, and there is already interest in collaboration from various regional Museums, non-profits, farms, and other entities, if only someone can get it up and running again. The biggest obstacle is funding.\n\nThis would be an initial Step in the framework of a non-profit I'll be starting in the next few years based on applying open-source versions of Ancient Technologies to modern problems of sustainability, and well as far more normal environmental work.\n\nHere's some on the project for those who aren't familiar: https://vermontsailfreightproject.wordpress.com/\n\nWhile it's not a silver bullet, it can be a proof-of-concept, raise awareness, work out kinks, and start people thinking. Paired with the Schooner Apollonia on the Hudson, there could be some major tonnage under sail, and non-profits don't have to make a profit to stay afloat, making it cheaper to ship with these vessels than any other way.\n\nWhat kinds of support am I not seeing? I have Museums, Farms, some Environmental Groups. Who Else? Where else can this work?",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/a37vwe/vermont_sail_freight_project_reboot/

9x619d,1542242359,I am a contractor that builds sustainable and alternative materials homes. I study horticulture and mycology and have a working understanding of microbiology and chemistry. My goal and plan for the last 15 years has been to create an alternative habitation that is carbon neutral to negative.,"My goal is to build homes to cope with potential consequences of climate change and a demand for clean air and food. Using passive and active, biological and chemical separation of nutrients and elements we can create habitable ecosystems that would thrive a lot like an earthworm in that bio mass goes in and useable nutrient rich soil comes out. Most of the work can be done through intelligent and intentional composting. A lot more work can be done with solar powered pumps, geo-thermal exchange and simple chemical reactions. Simple microprocessors attached to probes and sensors would monitor the environment and possibly even make adjustments independently. Positive pressure and strong seals can keep the interior as hermetic as possible. Underground in-house cellars and education in how to utilize them can revolutionize our current habits of food storage and be much less energy intensive.  In reality I am a hard working stone mason that is just getting by without enough funding to bring this dream to fruition. I am looking for a group or a singular patron that has or wants to purchase a piece of land to bring this project into reality. I’m open to any and all options and ways to keep the initial investment to a minimum. There are many potential possibilities to create revenue to cover the initial investment and make the project self sustainable. Some of the ways that I see readily available are creating a  wellness and relaxation retreat center. Organic food production is also highly profitable and I am  an advanced mycologist so bulk commercial and medicinal gourmet mushrooms are a guarantee. In vitro cell culture (plant tissue culture) is a great way to make revenue with ornamental plants like orchids and ferns. These are just some ideas that I have.

9temvm,1541114285,[Question] Employer deceiving customers with fake recycling bins.," Hi,\n\nI am writing because I am deeply concerned about my employer and their recycling habits. They have over 50 beverage recycling bins scattered throughout the property with an average of 500-1000 guests daily, but dump them all into the landfill bin. I was specifically told NOT to tell anyone that they do this as they wish to deceive their customers. I am wondering if there is a way that I can report this, and if so, to who? I wouldn't be as bothered by this if they were being transparent. However they deliberately bought city beverage recycling bins to make it seem as though they recycle. Small steps are key in order to reduce our impact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bothered by this because I'm getting my [B.Sc](https://B.Sc) in biology, but a lot of my credit hours have been from courses involving environmental sustainability.

Also I feel like people don't care about the environment because they are to busy with the distractions of everything else like cell phones and jobs and kids and so on, but if they were able to relax and clear they're minds they might have more time to consider living healthier and more in sync with the planet.

Climate change is now considered to be an existential risk to the human civilization by more and more scientists. Like most of you I am very concerned about climate change and the lack of action on this issue in Canada.Six months ago I decided to start work on a society to fight climate change here in Alberta. At the moment the focus of this society is working with municipal governments as they have direct and indirect control of approximately 50% of our greenhouse gas emissions. There is massive opportunity here in Alberta since we are so behind on green energy investment when compared to the rest of the world.\n\nI am seeking like minded individuals to help work on this society.

His question was on the lines of: \n\n“ How come you didn’t consult with native people at all, you are talking about climate protection from the industrial damage you have caused on the stolen land here. You should consult with native people first to begin any kind of reconciliation” \n\nI am still processing that statement.

9hisq8,1537476084,"[Discussion] What are the best sustainable Practices for Home Building? Also, Future-proofing?","My husband and I are kicking around building a new home on our farm. The old farmhouse is too old, too small, too leaky, with a poor floorplan. This is a three-generation farm and we're planning on keeping it going, so this new home will need to last centuries with (hopefully) only minor updates.\n\nA contractor friend basically said that trying to remodel our current home with eco-friendly practices would be more expensive and, in the long run, not as efficient as a new build. We can either carefully tear down the farmhouse and reuse salvageable materials in the new home, or leave it standing as a guest house/mother-in-law home.\n\nWe live in Wisconsin, zone 4b (for plants).\n\nDoing a bit of research, this is what I've come to understand:\n\nHeating and Cooling: I'll want thermal mass below the house to absorb the sun's heat. The house should be oriented with the long way facing south-north with the south facing having highly insulative windows and a deep overhang to shield the windows in the summer. Ideally the floor below these windows would be thermal mass and have a radiant flooring system throughout the rest of the level. Strategic windows should be able to open and a stack ventilation system created to suction out heat in the summer and re-vent it in the winter. The HVAC system should have programmable zones that automatically heat and cool the rooms of the house that are used at their specific times of day. I'm hoping to get away with not needing an air conditioning system and that the design itself keeps the house cool. As it stands, we only use window units in our current home when the exterior temps reach the nineties (maybe five non consecutive weeks out of the year). I saw on one website you can get programmable windows that open on their own when it senses the temperatures are right. I couldn't bear to look at the price of that, though. Solar thermal on the roof.\n\nDesign: the design of the home should be functional and flexible so that the rooms can be repurposed as our family's needs change. I was actually thinking about running plumbing, electrical (through conduit) on the exterior of the interior walls to try and future-proof any advancements (I keep thinking about the renovation work on the show Downton Abbey when they installed electrical). The roof could have solar water heating, and/or solar electric. Materials should be reused, recycled, sustainable or permanent. One website recommended flipping the traditional floor plan and having bedrooms on the ground floor and living spaces on the upper floors so that bedrooms stay cool in the summer. Is this a good idea? I was thinking in the summer it might be nice to have the kitchen on the ground floor so it gets cool air coming in, but with the HVAC system I wasn't sure if it was necessary. I was thinking about building in concrete, like I saw they do in Germany, with either locally quarried limestone or locally harvested cedar for siding as a way to reduce maintenance costs on the exterior.\n\nWater: We'll probably install a gray water waste water system. We have a rainwater collection system currently for our non potable water, that's fairly new, so that system will be moved, but we just dumped the gray water in the septic with the black water. The low flow fixtures will be moved, the energy star appliances as well. Solar water heating. We currently have a tankless, but I've heard electrical tankless are not efficient and I'm hoping to get rid of our propane tank with this build.\n\nQuestions:\n\nFirst, this is a wish-list, so what is most important and static (meaning, if it's not built-in, it's probably not going to happen? What could we add later, or is it all doable?\n\nI'm hoping heating can all be either passive solar or solar electrical, but if we can't do that is it better to remain on the grid and get electricity from the power plant or use a woodburning stove?\n\nSome websites were saying to have an open floor plan to make the space more flexible. Others were saying to seal everything up into zones to make the HVAC more efficient. Which is ultimately better?\n\nWhat's on the horizon? Should we delay for a few years because something awesome is coming (we delayed so far waiting for a good battery for solar storage).\n\nWhat's the best way to future-proof this home so it will work for the next three generations?\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/9hisq8/discussion_what_are_the_best_sustainable/

9g5o2b,1537051231,Accelerating CSR,"Hi guys,\n\nI have been thinking of Corporate social responsibility (CSR) quite a lot off late. I would like to start a discussion on all facets of this approach. \n\nTo begin, we are stuck in a Catch 22 situation in regards to the green economy going mainstream. We don’t have the jobs for people to transition to this economy and most people won’t quit their current jobs on the capitalistic paradigm to kick start the new economy.\n\nCSR may provide the bridge. If a critical mass of people quit their current jobs and get absorbed in existing NGO’s and push all big and medium  corporations to give more CSR donations, then we can use that money to slowly develop the green economy. The structure of the green economy will vary from the cultural and geographical aspects of the place. Right now, most corporations don’t give more than 1% of their annual revenues for CSR. So we need to develop a good moral and even long term financial pitch to get more CSR money from them. As part of meeting climate change targets, governments eventually need to put regulations to companies to give their share of CSR.  For that to happen, NGO’s need to give a showcase of case study of socio-economic benefits of CSR usage. \n\nI do understand that this approach is still treating the effects of the problem and not the root cause. But we need to start somewhere in more concrete fashion. \n\nIf you guys like this approach, would like to hear how we can develop a strong pitch to the corporations, considering that most upper management in these corporations lack any empathy towards climate change.

I know, two things right? Firstly, that's one hell of a mouth full. And secondly, Palestine's got a natural history museum?!?!\n\n**IMAGES:** [**https://imgur.com/a/BJFHBl6**](https://imgur.com/a/BJFHBl6)\n\nYes - to both. The museum's pretty small, with between 5 and 10 volunteers and staff at any given time. It's been running for about 4 years and is the brain child of the Director Dr Mazin Qumsiyeh and his wife Jessie. They started the project with a lump sum of their own money and now have the support of the Museum of Bethlehem.\n\nThe idea behind the museum is to create a better understanding of the natural environment in order to reduce conflict between Palestine and Israel. The whole complex run off 100% solar energy, maintains and grows food and fish with Aquaponics systems, builds using recycled materials (such as plastic bottles and other building materials that have been thrown away) and runs at virtually zero waste capacity.\n\nIt's a story of how one academic from Bethlehem decided to set a model for peaceful and sustainable living in the face of occupation by founding a museum. With the help of hundreds of international volunteers, bringing skills from aquaponics expertise to fine art, civil engineering, and even a computer programmer from MIT, Mazin and his wife Jessie are creating an oasis of sustainable technologies, ecological and cultural conservation initiatives, and a place of learning for the people of Palestine. A twenty-first century Garden of Eden, if you will.\n\nthe Museum functions largely as a research centre focussing on nature conservation, biodiversity, natural and cultural history, human environmental health and organic agriculture. Given the precarious political context the museum exists within, it quite rightly boasts it's native botanical garden, permaculture, beekeeping, greenhouse, aquaponics and hydroponics, ecological pond, and animal rehabilitation efforts.\n\nThe idea of a museum to research and document the flora and fauna of Palestine came from the Director's uncle, Dr Sana Atallah, the countries first zoologists who did research on the mammals of the eastern mediterranean.\n\nOne of the largest obstacles we face is that people either don’t know the museum exists, or they're concerned about the security of visiting Palestine when in neighbouring Israel. I’ve been tasked with trying to grow the museum's online presence in order to get word out and hopefully show it to potential visitors and volunteers from around the world.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning a little more or know somebody you think would be interested please do have a look at the links below.

9esw71,1536627515,"Offered to propose and implement a sustainable system/process within a commercial greenhouse, ideas would be appreciated!","I have been offered to propose and implement a project with a focus on sustainability in a large commercial greenhouse. Being the youngest in a well established operation, I'm ecstatic for the offer and acknowledgement  of the importance of sustainability within our farm. My issue is recognizing ""low hanging fruit"" or projects that wouldn't require *major* overhauls. My larger personal concerns would be plant container runoff (PGRs, fertilizers, insecticides etc), efficiency of drainage ponds and perhaps chemical use? I notice a lack of sustainability in many aspects of the farm so it's been somewhat difficult pin pointing an exact source that wouldn't require a large investment. \nIn short, if you're familiar with  successful sustainability projects/techniques I would greatly appreciate any suggestions as offers like these do not come around very often and I want to make the best out of what I have been given.

I’m not exactly sure what I want to do career wise yet- I’m interested in conservation bio, ecological restoration, wildlife studies, marine bio, and the environmental science side of things.\n\nUnlike most of my classmates, I haven’t had the chance to work in a lab with any professors yet because of my off campus job, 15+ unit semesters, and summer courses. I don’t have time yet, and the hours/pay for lab jobs on my campus would not support me if I quit my day job. \n\nI am, however, getting some ‘sustainability experience’ from\nworking on a Green Team at my current job. (I work as a floor manager and office clerk at a small market/cafe.) In this Green Team, I’m now overseeing 3 departments of the store, communicating and delegating to those department heads, researching how to make their departments more sustainable, monitoring and logging their waste bins (landfill/compost/recycle), and ultimately reporting to a Sustainability Coordinator at our corporate office. \n\nI’m loving this new side of my job and was wondering what sustainability career options there are if I end up going down this route? After my undergrad, I planned on doing internships to make up for my lack of experience, then most likely going back to school for my Masters. I love EEB, and I took the sustainability minor mostly because of my own interest in environmentalism, but now I’m wondering what it can actually do for me career-wise (if anything).\n\nThanks for the help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/9ddrwf/possible_careers/

97mi56,1534370499,Core problem with sustainability projects in Canada,"Background: \n\nHi, I am a chemical engineer by trade. I worked in the oil and gas industry in Alberta for 3 years. I quit my job last December, I have been volunteering and networking with people since then to get into this field. \n\nWhat I am looking for:\n\nMeeting 2030 emission targets for Canada. It’s a big challenge but its exciting.  It will involve everything with localization of food through urban farming, more public transit and bikes, green tech, less consumerism etc.  To achieve them, we need more social awareness and policies at city/federal level. \n\nWhat is existing:\n\nThere are few companies which are developing green technologies ( solar, wind, biomass etc) but not going mainstream. There are think tanks  which are giving good reports to governments and corporations, but the implementation of those reports not happening. I have applied to few of these companies, but no luck yet. Some universities have campus sustainability coordinators who are doing good work for the campus but scale up to rest of the city is missing. I have applied to those jobs too, no luck there too so far. \n\nDue to greenwashing in the media, ppl think driving electric car and recycling stuff is enough. This is harming the cause too. \n\nWhat is missing:\n\nTo achieve the 2030 emission targets, energy replacement with renewables and focus on energy efficiency is not enough.   We need to focus on energy conservation and energy regeneration. We can achieve that  by temporary degrowth of the economy( tough to convince ppl on this as they are worried about losing their current jobs) with circular economy principles. We need a critical mass of people to develop such an economy so that ppl can transition to this economy. That’s where catch 22 situation comes up. We need people to come out of fossil fuel economy to develop the green economy, which can be a big ask. \n\nAnother important thing is this field is inter-disciplinary in nature. Urban growers, ecological economists, technologists, psychologists, artists etc need to integrate their work for sound policy development and for awareness.\n\nIs there anyone thinking on these lines. I look forward to your feedback and open to other ideas. I am looking to colloborate with like minded people and any project suggestions will be helpful to me. Thanks a lot in advance.

92nxk3,1532799777,Toilet paper alternative,"So I've seen some articles about 'family cloths' as an alternative to toilet paper, which I find pretty unpractical and not very hygienic. So I thought I'd share another option to clean your butt.\nI've been Toilet paper free for about half a year now and I love it! Here is how I do it:\nI use what's called a portable bidet. It's a little squishy bottle with a jet on top. Here is what it looks like: \nhttps://smile.amazon.com/BioBidets-Handheld-Personal-Portable-Capacity/dp/B00O92IF6Q/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1532798771&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=portable+bidet\n\nBasically you fill this with water and clean yourself with the water stream. After that I have a towel to dry myself. Mind you that unlike the family cloth, this towel should never get dirty (If you do it right) and you can use it for a long time without it ever starting to smell. You may need to practice a bit to get completely clean, so use toilet paper for drying until you get the hang of it. The benefits of this are great. It's a lot more environment friendly, feels a lot nicer, gets you cleaner, and you never run out of toilet paper. If you want to get REALLY efficient, or if you're in a survival situation with limited water, you could even recycle your own urine (filtered with a charcoal filter to remove odor and color) to use instead of the water, making it a zero footprint solution. You know, if you're into that kinda stuff ;) Tell me what you think about this and if you have any questions :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/92nxk3/toilet_paper_alternative/

Their degree is called 'Sustainability &amp; Environmental Management' and is structured thusly:\n\nYear 1: International environmental law &amp; policy. Sustainable solutions to environmental problems. Sustainable business management. \n\nYear 2: Pollution assessment and remediation. Low carbon energy management. Environmental impact assessment + research module (dissertation project.)\n\nThe other university is ranked very highly for prestige (top 25 in the world) and for teaching but their degree is called 'Carbon Management' and is structured very much around corporate responsibility in the face of climate change. My fear is that this is a little bit too niche of a degree. While other universities deliver their material with climate change in mind, this university frames the entire structure of the degree with climate change. Here's how it looks:\n\nYear 1: Climate change impacts &amp; adaptations. Climate change mitigation. Climate change &amp; corporate responsibility.\n\nYear 2: Carbon economics. Climate change measurement. Energy &amp; Climate + research module (dissertation.)\n\nOf the two universities, I am certain that the latter will offer me more networking opportunities but I feel that the former teaches more employable skills. \n\nWhat are you thoughts if you work in this field? Do things like prestige matter at all? \n\nI should mention that in my spare time I'm learning R, Python, and QGIS since none of the universities here seem to teach it on environmental Msc degrees.\n\nYour advice and knowledge is really really appreciated.

I frequently hear the argument that it takes x amount of resources for every pound of cow meat, but that's non-existent if all the cows were grass fed.

8xz0db,1531310905,ENJOYNEER- We are inspiring the next generation of makers to tackle our global challenges! YOUR SUPPORT &amp; FEEDBACK IS NEEDED REDDIT COMMUNITY!,"![video](bwxcyqgu6b911 ""Check Out Our Promo Video!"")\n\n**Why Enjoyneer, you ask?**\n\nOften, it's a chance encounter or occurrence that leads to great things. For one man, that chance encounter was a near-death experience that ended up leading to inspiration. Enjoyneer founder Sandeep began his career in the field of engineering, but after an incident when angry Eastern European football hooligans chased him, everything changed. That encounter led to a head injury and left Sandeep not only hurt but with one clear impression - that their actions weren't their fault. As angry as they were, they were human as well. Humans that were victims of their circumstances.\n\nAs a result of that experience, Sandeep began focusing on helping to change circumstances for everyone. He quickly realised that the engineering world lacked the compassion that was needed to improve the world. Since founding, the online media platform Enjoyneer has been focusing its attention on the future. And now, founder Sandeep has started the final push to bring new perspectives to the world and help the brilliant minds out there shape a better, brighter tomorrow for us all.\n\n![img](f7i61uax6b911 ""This is a snapshot of our Website"")\n\n**The Three Phases of Enjoyneer**\n\nSandeep embraced compassion and kindness, which changed his entire life. And now, Enjoyneer is a vehicle that is designed to build a community around the idea of shaping a better future. Sandeep's vision for the company has three distinct phases:\n\n1. To report on the significant innovations and individuals who are already changing the world - and those that will change it in the future. Along the way, Enjoyneer will raise awareness about the benefits of positive change and innovation.\n2. The launch of Innovation Lab, which will work on ideas that tackle the most significant challenges around the globe through direct development and action.\n3. The deployment of the inventions that spring from the Innovation Lab. Additionally, to grow into the most extensive media platform for the future generation of creators.\n\nA Snapshot from our Website\n\nBy being a platform that helps bring great minds together and inspire them, Enjoyneer aims to create a better world and to reach it by making it easier to find inspiration and to work together for change.\n\n**Big Challenges, Big Changes**\n\nIt isn't difficult to understand why the vision of Enjoyneer is so essential. Just take a look at some of the many global challenges that we need to address over the coming years, and it's clear why this endeavour deserves attention.\n\n* Over the next 20 years, the population of the planet is predicted to increase by 2 billion. And 95&amp;#37; of that increase will take place in underdeveloped countries.\n* By 2050 the planet must produce 60&amp;#37; more food than it currently does to feed everyone.\n* As many as 1.2 billion will still be without electricity by 2030.\n* Already, 800 million are without access to clean, safe water around the world. That number will only grow along with the planet's population.\n* 2.4 billion lack improved sanitation facilities. 80&amp;#37; of illnesses in developing countries are directly caused by poor water quality and lack of sanitation.\n* Global pollution continues to be a significant issue, impacting the world's air and having an impact on global warming as well.\n* Renewable energy sources will contribute 26&amp;#37; of the global energy grid by 2020. Several countries are committed to exceeding that number.\n\nIn short, the world needs help - and Enjoyneer is committed to providing that help. What Enjoyneer Needs Simply put, Enjoyneer needs help. With inspiration and innovation, it's possible to change the world and confront the global challenges we face. By supporting Enjoyneer's Indiegogo campaign, you'll be helping the organisation grow and achieve its mission goals - and help it change the world.\n\n*Please find a link for Enjoyneer's Indiegogo campaign below:*\n\n[https://igg.me/at/enjoyneer/x](https://igg.me/at/enjoyneer/x)\n\nAny amount, big or small, is appreciated.

8w4tvr,1530736800,Signs of collapse 2018 Q2,"Hi /r/Sustainability! I have been working on an ongoing project for little over two years now nick-named [”[Signs of collapse]”]( https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.\n \nI try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.\n\nI define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.\n \nI’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.\n \n**Previous posts:**\n\n* [Signs of collapse 2018 Q1](https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/88s8mb/signs_of_collapse_q1_2018/)\n\n* [Signs of collapse 2017 - Q4 &amp; Summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/7oqcc0/signs_of_collapse_2017/)\n\n* [Signs of collapse Q3 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/73i3fx/signs_of_collapse_q3_2017/)\n\n* [Signs of collapse Q2 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/6kmlzo/signs_of_collapse_q2_2017/)\n\n* [Signs of collapse Q1 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/64kw6p/signs_of_collapse_q1_2017/)\n\n* [Signs of collapse 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/)\n\n--------------------\n \n**Signs of Collapse 2018 Q2**\n \n**Human well-being &amp; non-specific climate change**\n\n* [Limits to Growth was right.

A system that we had NO say within from birth, we were born and then we were forced \(time to be honest about this part\) into an educational system that literally ONLY teaches you how to become a product/robot to sustain the system you were born into, with no question, it is just the way it works, sorry son/daughter, you must just suffer like us all through this, become an adult and destroy yourself as a child to sustain this mechanical cold system that functions off this thing that was invented called money, at ALL costs \-\-\&gt; Literally.   \n\n\nNature as literally the living organism on this planet as one entity under one name \(nature\) makes life for all of us possible, has less space on this planet we apparently call our Mother to flourish and live and give life, than what we tiny humans take and destroy. It is truly a very strange thing to sustain, and literally to dedicate 18 years of every human to brainwash them to without question sustain such a system and imbalance.   \n\n\nIn reality, Nature should be flourishing at least \(minimum\) on 70&amp;#37; of the earth surface without human interaction to have a sustainable future for all life as long as time is here.   \n\n\nWe are supposed to be the ones fencing ourselves off from nature, not fence off nature from us and limiting natures space. that is insanity.

In the future I might have the chance to lead and work on some projects and I wonder if there are any books that tackle this issue so I can get ideas and see real-life cases of how those small-scale projects made an impact in the environment and the community.\n\nThe budget for these projects won't be bigger than USD$10,000 and I'm really looking for books/websites/studies/blogs that discuss the whole planning process and how the budget was allocated. Numerical analysis of the impact these projects had would be amazing.\n\nTL;DR: Any literature on small sustainability projects where I can get ideas and learn how they impacted the environment (ideally with figures, charts, etc)",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/8epsia/books_about_sustainable_projects/

8eckmi,1524499371,I want to learn more about sustainable design as a career,"Copy-pasting this in a few subreddits (tried to in r/implado, but they don't seem to allow text posts. have any of you seen that subreddit? i've read some interesting links found there) and thought I'd ask it here as well. Apologies if it's out of place. Just trying to find some advice!\n\nI'm looking for advice on how to move into a career in sustainable design. Before I start reaching out to people irl and making those first impressions, I wanted to see what I could find out to prepare myself for those initial conversations.\n\nI'm an environmental consultant mainly with experience in site characterization, which involves data collection and interpretation. I have an engineering degree and an affinity for the visual medium. My firm is not involved in any design work.\n\nIn college I dealt with an uncertain major, as many do. Late in college, I asked myself one last time if I should change majors. I considered computational media and architecture. I decided to stick with environmental engineering (EnvE). When I think about why I started EnvE to begin with, I recall a personality test I took that had a description for the EnvE profession. I remember the picture that went with that description. That of a house cross section with arrows going in every direction, indicating energy flow. I thought the idea of designing and implementing these energy efficient, and possibly renewable, systems in public or private spaces sounded cool.\n\nThat stuck out to me. Yet that is one example of many where this idea of designing, and its connection to environmental sustainability, occurred to me. But I sort of forgot about those these past couple years; I guess that happens when you start your first job and move to a new state.\n\nAnyways, I've been reading more about sustainable design and the exciting technologies being tested and used in the real world. And I remind myself that maybe I could be designing things. I want to learn more about sustainable design. What skills are relevant?\n\nI've seen LEED and PE certifications among professionals. However, can I get into entry level without them? I have used AutoCAD professionally and a little bit of Revit, if that's relevant.\n\nThank you for reading!

8ag3im,1523079248,Bathing and Water Conservation,"Hello all!\n\nI am part of a non-profit that is taking on a project to house homeless people in Las Vegas. It will be a tiny home community with seven homes in all, shared facilities, outdoor kitchen, and gardens.\n\nOne of the biggest problems we have to contend with is water. There is not much of it in the valley to begin with, and what is available is highly regulated. In my research, I discovered that the average American uses 80-100 gallons a day (or more!) and most of that comes from showers and toilets. \n\nWe have already been considering using composting toilets, or some other dry method for the residents of the community. I am fairly certain that the heat here will make thermophilic composting highly effective, and will also provide material for the gardens.\n\nThe people that are actually doing the building want to build a shower facility, with regular run-of-the-mill water wasting showers. It got me thinking about more sustainable method of bathing. Most homeless people in Las Vegas are already masters of water conservation, I have seen people that live in the flood tunnels that use plastic jugs hung from the ceiling in order to shower. So where the average person uses 30-50 gallons just for their daily shower, many of the homeless are using a gallon or less!\n\nSo, does anybody know of any sustainable bath ideas? Maybe a bath house design that helps conserve water, or methods that are a bit more obscure than just using a bucket and sponge? Are there any real world examples of conservative bathing that I should be looking at?\n\nThanks for the help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/8ag3im/bathing_and_water_conservation/
8ae263,1523057131,Sustainable sociology,"Hello,\n\nI am just speaking my mind here and wondering about some things...\n\nSo to become a truly sustainable society we must adjust our standards of living.  I have done this considerably since I began my studies.  Learning about the damage you personally cause to the environment is a great way to change your own behaviors.\n\nHowever, don't you think most people would experience burnout with this?  I've joked/talked with friends and family members here and there perhaps about not needing a nice car or big house, improving their homes energy efficiency, avoiding cruises and airlines rather than aspiring to them... you know, sustainable stuff.  \n\nHowever, I realize that most of this in their view diminishes quality of life.  I somewhat agree with them too.  I wonder if I too am simply a product of my generation, conditioned to want things and experience the entire world.  I find that these are primary motivators for most people as we increasingly find ourselves in a society with less and less divine motivation and with marriages and child births happening at later ages.  What most people live for then is to be socially accepted, well liked and considered successful.  \n\nTo get Americans on this path without a very strong autocratic hand seems so difficult after our history of overtly encouraging limitless consumption consumption.\n\nI guess what i'm asking for is a pick-me-up.  How do you guys stay motivated in a field where you know that probably 90% of Americans will be unwilling to decrease their standards of living?  \n\nI understand that there are constitutional representative republics and democracies that do indeed take a heavy top-down approach toward sustainability.

89dt0a,1522762541,Any ideas for my term paper? No prompt!,"Hey guys, for my sustainability class (geared towards identifying the differences between greenwashing and true sustainability) I have to write a term paper on anything I like. It has to be eight pages double-spaced, due by the end of today. \n\nThe lack of prompt is impeding me more than I expected and I can't seem to choose one topic to write about. \n\nSome of the things we have discussed in class are the effects of the industrial revolution, what historical events have allowed for capitalism to flourish, what greenwashing is and examples of it, why people don't care about the environment, how humans try to separate themselves from nature and why, and what the future holds.\n\nI'm open to things like ""write about why plastic bags are so horrible and a solution, like a ban, or consumers having to bring their own"", etc., but this class has kind of opened my eyes to the dystopia we're living in and I feel so hopeless about it that those type of solutions seem a bit fruitless. I'm more interested in the relationship between humans and nonhumans and how we treat them/separate ourselves from them, but that has to connect back to sustainability. I'm also interested in the primitive anthropology of humans and how we ended up where we are today.\n\nThe professor is very chill (this paper was supposed to be handed in last Thursday I just didn't show up with one), there is no prompt at all so I can argue something or just rant or provide a history of something. \n\nIf anyone has a budding question or topic that sounds relevant and interesting I would LOVE to hear it.

88s8mb,1522602028,Signs of collapse q1 2018,"Hi /r/Sustainability! I have been working on an ongoing project for little over two years now nick-named [”[Signs of collapse]”]( https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in that in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand were we are now and which path we are on.  To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.\n \nI try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.\n\nI define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.\n \nI’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.\n \n**Previous posts:**\n\n* [Signs of collapse 2017 - Q4 &amp; Summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/7oqcc0/signs_of_collapse_2017/)\n\n* [Signs of collapse Q3 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/73i3fx/signs_of_collapse_q3_2017/)\n\n* [Signs of collapse Q2 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/6kmlzo/signs_of_collapse_q2_2017/)\n\n* [Signs of collapse Q1 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/64kw6p/signs_of_collapse_q1_2017/)\n\n* [Signs of collapse 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/)\n\n--------------------\n \n**Signs of Collapse 2017**\n \n**Human well-being &amp; non-specific climate change**\n\n* [Top Climate Scientist: Humans Will Go Extinct if We Don't Fix Climate Change by 2023](https://gritpost.com/humans-extinct-climate-change/)\n\n* [Murders in Puerto Rico Surge as Hurricane Maria Recovery Continues](http://time.com/5099781/puerto-rico-murder-rate-hurricane-maria/)\n\n* [India most vulnerable country to climate change - HSBC report](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-hsbc/india-most-vulnerable-country-to-climate-change-hsbc-report-idUSKBN1GV20Z)\n \n**Economy, Politics &amp; Industry**\n\n* [Doomsday clock ticks ½ min closer to midnight due to lack of action to counter nuclear war and climate change.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock)\n\n* ['At home, we couldn't get by': more Venezuelans flee as crisis deepens | World news](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/17/venezuela-migrants-americas-leaving-home)\n\n* [Mad Max violence stalks Venezuela's lawless roads](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy-trucks-widerimage/mad-max-violence-stalks-venezuelas-lawless-roads-idUSKBN1FT1G9)\n\n* [Extreme cold results in severe agricultural damage across Europe, food prices rising](https://watchers.news/2018/03/05/extreme-cold-results-in-severe-agricultural-damage-across-europe-food-prices-rising/)\n\n* [Hotter, Drier, Hungrier: How Global Warming Punishes the World’s Poorest](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/climate/kenya-drought.html)\n\n* [Some millennials aren’t saving for retirement because they don’t think capitalism will exist by then](https://www.salon.com/2018/03/18/some-millennials-arent-saving-for-retirement-because-they-do-not-think-capitalism-will-exist-by-then/)\n \n**Biodiversity**\n \n* [UK's favourite wildlife species at risk of extinction 'without revolution in disastrous modern food farming' - Skylarks, nightingales and birds of prey all at risk, but officials ‘blame climate change instead of tackling vested interests destroying nature’](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/wildlife-extinct-revolutionise-food-farming-species-declines-wiped-out-a8233511.html) \n\n* [Mass die-off of sea creatures follows freezing UK weather | Environment](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/05/mass-die-off-of-sea-creatures-follows-freezing-uk-weather)\n\n**Pests, viruses and bacterial infections**\n \n* [Deadly superbug just got scarier - It can mysteriously thwart last-resort drug](https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/03/scary-superbug-can-sneakily-dodge-last-resort-drug-and-we-dont-know-how/)\n\n**Ice and water**\n\n* [In 2017, the oceans were by far the hottest ever recorded | John Abraham | Environment](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jan/26/in-2017-the-oceans-were-by-far-the-hottest-ever-recorded)\n\n* [Oxygen Levels in Oceans Are Dropping Dangerously](https://www.usnews.com/news/at-the-edge/articles/2018-01-26/oxygen-levels-in-oceans-are-dropping-dangerously)\n \n* [Cape Town faces Day Zero, with officials predicting water will run out in April](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-28/day-zero-looms-for-cape-town/9368540http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-28/day-zero-looms-for-cape-town/9368540)\n\n* [First ship crosses Arctic in winter without an icebreaker as global warming causes ice sheets to melt.

Materials science will be the priority. Packaging will still exist, but they're made from plant-based materials that are not too energy-intensive to produce. The plantations for these plant sources will be maintained from the composted packaging materials + all the usual composted stuff, creating a closed loop.\n\nThat way, we'll still have the convenience of plastics and disposables. We  won't accidentally destroy for forests mining for metals with the increased demand for metal straws. We won't use up more water having to wash all our reusables. We won't end up with cloth and metal items that will cause more damage when they eventually have to be thrown away.\n\nThoughts? Is this already happening or.being discussed somewhere?

867z3b,1521683778,How To END Pollution,"The biggest obstacle to sustainability is overcoming our unconscious resentment of money. Let me explain. \n\nI’m sure we can all agree that we resent money hungry big businesses because they consume our natural resources just so they can make a quick buck. But when we reflect upon our own actions, occasionally we resent making money because we consumed the most precious resource for it, our time.  Now, the process of evolution has trained us to attack anything that consumes our time because at an unconscious level we feel like our very survival is under threat. So today, that means we instinctively react by destroying money, as making it consumed our time, but this is a huge problem because of 2 reasons; money isn’t attacking us and money is the most universal and most efficient system of trust ever devised. When we consume money, we destroy trust and without trust we aren’t able to cooperate and build a sustainable future. \n\nThe reality is, we have defeated the survival of the fittest problem and our very desire to survive is now working against us. Life is tough and life’s goal is to create more life. And so far as we know, no other life has made it to such a highly evolved state before, where it is conscious enough to be aware of it’s own consciousness. \nHere are some facts to consider;\n•	Homo sapiens are jus one of at least 30 billion different species of organism to have lived on earth.\n•	More than 99.99% of any species to ever have existed is extinct. \n•	Our species spread around the globe 70,000 years ago thanks to our first major revolution, the cognitive revolution.\n•	The next revolution, the agricultural revolution, enabled our population to grow rapidly.\n•	The scientific revolution enabled our growth to explode. \n•	If we scale planet earth’s existence down to one single day, our 70,000-year domination is represented by less than 1 second.  \n•	We are in a revolution now. \n\nEverybody knows it already. We feel like we are on the edge of leaping into space, giving birth to AI, becoming more conscious of our actions, or plunging down into chaos, into destruction, into disorder. \n\nWe have created incredible tools to help us trust each other. We can both use them and keep making them better to find our solution, or we can be part of the problem. \n\nSince we live in a capitalist/consumerist world, our most important tool right now is money because it is what we use to represent trust. Here is a 4-step process that you can follow that will help you become more conscious of appreciating money and if you follow this correctly, your wealth must increase.\n\n1.	Awareness\nBegin by paying more attention to the things that you buy that you grow to resent. Resentment is the feeling that comes from being consumed, from unsustainability. This changes for everyone and there is no generic answer. It could be a yearlong gym membership, an expensive wine, a holiday, petrol or tomatoes wrapped in plastic. \n\n2.	Acceptance\nIt doesn’t really matter why you resent that purchase, but you do need to accept that it unconsciously makes you loose trust in others and it makes you angry. You feel that way because you traded your limited resource, time, for money and now spend your money on something that you don’t appreciate. The problem is, you don’t know how to find ways to use money on things that appreciate, so you can build trust in others.\n\n3.	Alignment\nMany people today resent one time use plastic and so do everything they can to avoid it, but sometimes still can’t. But what if you knew of people that were engineering a solution out of plastic? Perhaps it is an alternative that is made from renewable resources and is biodegradable? Or maybe it’s an organisational system that makes it easier to reuse an existing container than consume a new one? Whatever the solution, if you can develop trust in it, you have found alignment. You have found a version of the solution you are excited by.  \n\n4.	Action\nOnce you’ve found someone that can reliably create results, by taking action and investing in them, you create trust. If the people you trust are indeed trustworthy, you will get feedback, the money you invested in them must appreciate. The consequence is a miracle, you help create a future you love and your wealth increases. You are rewarded because you have taken ownership of creating a better future by trusting and cooperating with other passionate change makers like yourself.  \n\nThe best-case example for sustainable living isn’t a tree hugging hippie, but Warren Buffett, the most successful investor of our era. He takes out the top spot because over his life so far he has donated some $30bn to charities. Starting from scratch, he now is valued at $90bn. Now, he doesn’t have that money sitting in his bank, it is all invested in businesses that he values, ones that are creating the solutions the world needs. But what makes him a real super human is; despite his unfathomable wealth, he still lives frugally. He lives in the first house he ever bought which is valued at less than $300k, drives the same car for decades and spends less than $4 on his breakfast. Buffett doesn’t spend his money on things that he doesn’t appreciate; he invests it all so that it does appreciate. \n\nCreating sustainability today requires nothing more than consciously appreciating your money. \n\nThe first two steps I just described are extremely important because they will lead you to a place where you can start to make change. They will lead you to forgive others that have betrayed your trust by taking your money, your time. They will also help you become more conscious of spending your money only on things that you trust will create a better future for yourself and others. It is a constant challenge. \n\nThe next step is to invest, but sadly you’ve probably already tried that and now feel resentful about having tried because you lost your money. So before ever investing again, you owe it to yourself to find out how wealthy people like Warren Buffett can invest every year and never loose. If it’s humanly possible, consider it within your reach. \n\nI’ve got a few starting points and will be glad to share them here if people find this article useful. Leaves some comments and I’ll provide examples of sustainable, conscious businesses, that if you had invested in, would have created you additional wealth. \n\nLet’s shift forward together\n:-)",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/867z3b/how_to_end_pollution/

81s9zq,1520104609,Buying From Local Farms-Is it worth it?,"I've been looking at buying eggs, fruit/veg, and meats from local farms but I want to make sure this is a good idea from a sustainability standpoint.\n\nThere are numerous farms just outside my city that offer a variety of options.  A one time pick up of meats that I could freeze and weekly boxes of fruit/veg and possibly eggs that I could pick up or have dropped off are the most prevalent options.  \n\nI realize that this is more sustainable in that the products aren't travelling as far and aren't being packaged in plastic but instead cardboard and that waxy red paper for the meat.  But, I'm wondering how much of that is offset by my having to drive there to pick up the products weekly or have them dropped off.  For reference it is 2.5kms to my usual grocery store and about 15kms to the closest of the farm pick up locations.  Although I would love to bike there, it just isn't realistic since these are rural highways and I would have to bring two kids with me.  I'm also wondering about waste, I've heard a lot of people who get these kinds of boxes dropped off end up getting items they aren't sure how to use, or more of some items than they need and thus they go to waste.  I generally freeze fruits/veg if we have more than we eat before they spoil, but if we get too much every single week the freezer would very quickly fill up.  \n\nI know I could go to the farmers markets each week but again, travelling there using gas has to be factored in, and the cost at those is massively higher and seems to be an ridiculous waste.\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/81s9zq/buying_from_local_farmsis_it_worth_it/

I've done my own research, but struggled to find a comparable project out there, so I'm hoping someone here might know of something. \n\nIn a nutshell, the idea is to create a virtual hub (website and/or social media community) that centralizes, consolidates, and hosts information related to ALL aspects of sustainability: society, economics, environment, governance (politics), culture, ethics, and technology, to name 7 core areas. \n\nInitially, this would only integrate information (events, announcements, etc) from across the campus' student societies. Even that, however, is a big task. \n\nOne issue we have at ANU is that we have a crazy amount of separate student groups all related in one way or another to sustainability and sustainable developent. One look at the [United Nations Sustainable Development Goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals) will illustrate just how broad the entire discipline is, and at a big uni like mine with many clubs, how many different groups might fall under the umbrella of sustainability. \n\nI'm looking for a university that already attempts (or better, achieves) something like this, where disparate student clubs and organizations are drawn together under the umbrella of sustainability to encourage information-sharing, collaboration, and cross-institutional engagement. \n\nThanks for any help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/7vfean/i_want_to_create_a_sustainability_hub_on_my/

I trained at the Design School and School of Education as an undergraduate, and now teach storytelling workshops and share stories told by unexpected authors: children from underserved communities.\n\nI am working on supporting that model with an economically-sustainable cycle. I'm designing a regular sponsorship program, in which I design, illustrate, and print storybooks from the stories authored by students in our workshops, then deliver these storybooks to the doorsteps of families around the world, and use the proceeds to fund future workshops.\n\nThe most beautiful part about this model is that one student’s story provides for the next.\n\nI’m posting this just to offer an example of sustainable and social-heavy economic practices in the works. I have seen a fair amount of skepticism about that very possibility (“Economic growth will destroy everything”).\n\nI encourage you all to check out our just-launched Kickstarter to get a feel for the power of our workshops and our model. I believe that this model will allow us to produce immense social good – it’s not a drastic uprooting but a tweak, buoyed by a different ethos or approach to economic development. It will enable us to deploy workshops in Nepal, the Yucatán, Lesotho, and Ghana over the coming months. Your support could help immensely, as well!\n\nThe link is here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1689025506/rakonto-global-stories-written-by-students-for-stu\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas!\n\nThanks for your time,\nSawyer",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/7gh2j3/doing_good_with_a_sustainable_economic_model/
7ggykd,1511991710,Thoughts on Sustainability,"Hello everyone, I am a community college student and I would like to share my thoughts on the idea of living sustainably.\n\nYou see, this fall semester, I was a part of a class called Introduction to Sustainability. It is everything relating to living resource-efficiently, both globally and locally. It was a new subject, and it came with a new format. It was a student-led class. We came up with our syllabus and planned what we were going to do. The whole thing was new. At the time, I had no real interest in the subject; I was only taking to class to fill up an elective. At least half-way through the semester, I started to think a tiny bit differently. I did not commit to any huge changes, but rather, I paid more attention to some more bite-size solutions. \n\nBoth in and out of class, what we learned reminded me that even though the problems facing our earth’s sustainability are large and gloomy, we could still do something. I remembered listening to one of our guest speakers, a government worker whose life motto was to live sustainably. Meeting someone like him was surprising and quite interesting. I liked the idea of living that nobly and kindly. Sure, not everyone can be like that. We are all born and raised into our own little niche (or maybe not so niche) social circles. Nevertheless, maybe the solution is not for everyone to go hardcore sustainable anyway. That probably is not even economically and socially feasible. \n\nWe like to learn, and buy, and do. If we could look out for ways to live healthier, save energy, and be more aware of our environmental impact in some of the ways we act, it could do us well. Throughout this long semester, I have realized that much. \n\nI have included a few links to sites that outline some solutions to being semi, or at the very least, minimally sustainable. Some are simple, like shopping more green or being minimalistic (while others are a little more extreme).\n\nhttps://www.conserve-energy-future.com/15-ideas-for-sustainable-living.php\n\nhttp://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/population_and_sustainability/sustainability/live_more_sustainably.html\n\nhttp://www.dummies.com/education/science/environmental-science/ten-ways-to-live-sustainably/\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/7ggykd/thoughts_on_sustainability/

70whb9,1505755022,Idea for my University,"I've heard about other countries using stationary bikes in homes to power homes/communities, but I'm not sure about many of the details. That being said, I work at my university's gym where we have about a dozen stationary bikes and maybe two dozen ellipticals. I think it would be a great way to power our campus, given that there is usually a large amount of patron traffic on these machines at any given time during our hours. It could even take our campus off of the city's power grid, although I'm not sure how well that would go over with the city.\n\nThe main issues I've thought of are:\n1. Storage- our campus would need a new space/building for storing the energy generated \n\n2. Engineering- generators, wiring, and labor are all costly, and our school doesn't even have an engineering department \n\n3. Funding- the TN governor has already given us funding for a new music building and football stadium, I doubt that he'd fund something that would take away from city revenue. \n\nAny suggestions on how to make this more practical? Or is this all just wishful thinking?\n\nEdit: Sorry guys, I guess this is one of those things that just sounds good on paper....like communism.

6zt1a1,1505287071,The Drawback of cell phone wireless charging,"Hi all,\n\nI wanted to bring to your awareness the effects of Apple implementing wireless charging across their whole lineup of new phones. Some research into Apple's current lightning charger revealed that the small 5W charger is just about 78% efficient. Qi (the tech Apple uses) hovers at around 59.4% efficiency, based on their own studies. This difference may seem fairly small, but in fact is a huge sustainability failure. What an 18% difference in efficiency means is that just 60% of the power spent actually makes it to the battery, leaving 40% dumped as lost waste heat. Compared to the wall charger, which only wastes 22%. Modern computer power supplies can achieve 80-90% efficiencies, which is even better.\n\n\nWhen you consider that there are roughly 1 billion active Apple phone users worldwide, constantly in need of a charge, the situation starts to become more clear. \n\nThe Math Part\n\nLet's assume everyone has brand new iPhone 7's, since they are familiar to me. I need to charge my phone every other day, which seems to be above average performance compared to my friends. The battery in the iPhone 7 is 1960mAh, or 1.96Ah producing 7.04 watt-hours of output. Including the losses from a wall charger, charging a phone from 0% will take 9.03 watt-hours from the grid to charge it, while the wireless charging system make it take 11.8 watt-hours. This results in a difference of 2.77 watt-hours total, or 1.36 wH as I charge my phone halfway each day.\n\n\nNow we convert that to kWh, resulting in .00136 kWh per phone, per day. And multiply that by one billion people, resulting in... 1,360,000 kWh that we are now dumping into the atmosphere as waste heat every day, just so we can avoid plugging in our phones. And that is 1.36 MW of power that needs to be generated, every day, for us to have this neat feature on our phones. That's roughly $64,500,000 USD worth of power, every year, being used up because we chose to charge our phones using an inferior method of charging.\n\n\nI've heard a few arguments about improving wireless charging, that the efficiencies can be pushed to 70% or above. The problem is, that will require far better precision (and cost) than is practical, and meanwhile we could have made better wired chargers that are above 85-90% efficiency. So the gap stays about the same when we push both technologies to their limits, and thus the cost overhead.\n\n\nWireless charging is not a very sustainable practice, unless you somehow compensate for the poor efficiency by making material savings, better longevity, etc.\n\n\nTL;DR: Wireless charging is bad for the environment. There are so many phones that a small change in efficiency makes a significant impact to world energy grid usage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/6zt1a1/the_drawback_of_cell_phone_wireless_charging/

He also volunteers at the ILFI, and he is in process of obtaining the ILFI certification.]\n\nWe briefly considered this degree for him: http://www.southseattle.edu/programs/bas/sustainable-building-science-technology/Default.aspx\nBut ended up not pursuing it because the wonderful Reddit community alerted us that this was too specific of the Northwest, and since our goal is to move back to Europe in a few years, that would not be ideal.\n\nSo now we are considering this one: http://www.southseattle.edu/programs/academics/areas-of-study/civil-environmental-engineering.aspx\n\nAnd would love to hear your input and opinion about it, if you have any.

I just realized how to end over consumption and make everyone on the planet equal in the amount they can consume. We do not need implants for currency, we need implants so that we can control consumption! \n\nIf everyone on the planet could only buy a certain number of pens each year, certain number of lighters, certain number of everything, few pounds of each meat, certain amount of soda, etc. etc. Limited by the carrying capacity of the planet and what we have already claimed for the production of goods and refuse to expand then we could end all the debates. Assign a footprint to every one on the planet based on population and resource projections. Use technology used for systems like bitcoin etc that have had to become corruption proof and encode a small implant.\n\nYou go shopping and at the checkout place your hand or arm on a reader. Opps, you already used all your beef credits for the month. NO SOUP FOR YOU!\nyou try to buy your third pack of pens this year, wrong. NO PEN FOR YOU.\nScrew trying to get Walmart, Bic, and Unilever to take control of consumption, madman time.\n\nIf you could purchase credits from a guy in a poor place, the place will not be poor for long.

6i8o7a,1497900027,Career advice for sustainability (part II),"Hi everyone!\n\nA month ago I asked for career advice in behalf of my husband who studied a BA in Anthropologie, and years later realized that his passion is actually Sustainability! Currently he works in Real Estate as a property manager for commercial buildings and has some involvement in Sustainability operations (to improve energy consumption and stuff like that), even though it is not his main job duty. He also volunteers at the ILFI, and he is in process of obtaining the ILFI certification.\n\nWe have been considering this degree:\nhttp://www.southseattle.edu/programs/bas/sustainable-building-science-technology/Default.aspx\n\nAnd would like to ask you your opinion on how far do you think this can take him? IS it a good option for him to apply for it? Is it the best option?\n\nOur goal is to move to Europe in about 3 years from now (I am from Europe), and we want to make sure that he will have a competitive strong professional profile to survive in the dark waters of the European job market. (For example, Passivhaus seems to have super strict requirements for admision and looks like unless he is an architect he won't be able to get that certification :/ would that screw up his chances at a successful career in Europe?)\n\nAnother of his goals is to eventually start his own Sustainability consultation company. So we want to chose a degree that can better prepare him for that.\n\nDo you think that is a good degree for that? Are there any other degrees that you think would serve him best (and that he can access without having any background in Engineering or Architecture)?\n\nAnother option we had been considering is the Architecture Masters at UW, which offers a 4 year program for students who have a non related background. However, is it very expensive, 4 years is a long time, and the full time schedule would require him to quit his job (where he is currently obtaining some Sustainability related experience). \n\nYour advice is very welcome! We are overwhelmed by all the info and haunted by all the decisions we didn't make, and we immensely appreciate your input. \n\nThank you in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/6i8o7a/career_advice_for_sustainability_part_ii/

6er3is,1496364068,Persuasion for humanity,"&gt; Not all advertising has to be evil \n\nWanting to share your beliefs without imposing on the freedom of others\n\n### The healthy option\n\nCompromising on one's values can slowly eat away at their sense of self, their confidence and their ability not to compromise in future situations. Perhaps this is contributing to global cases of mental health problems, in that we deep down can understand the effects of habitat destruction, but continue to compromise and consume the products which destroy it.\n\nMaybe you've come to realise this, you're now less stressed, confident in yourself and living in a way you believe is beneficial to others. \n\nBut, what about your friend? Your family? The rest of the world? You want to help them to feel good about themselves, conserve our shared environment and help others. What's stopping you?\n\n### Don't tell me what to think!\n\nI know I've never appreciated people telling me what to think, let alone what to believe. I imagine most people are the same.\n\nRecently, I encountered a person who, after a minute of chit chat, started to tell me I must believe in Jesus and pray for us all, then proceeded on a 20-minute one-way conversation about aliens, Beyonce, reptillian people and other interesting, though unlikely, theories, such as the Large Hadron Collider being used to open a portal to the demonic underworld. \n\nWhilst a little alarming, I wasn't otherwise indisposed, so it was interesting to experience this person, so excited about their beliefs. 20 mins was enough though, so to much relief, after they left, my flatmate and I had a chat about it. We're not the sort of people to say they shouldn't have believed in what they did, but felt that if their intent was to convert me to their way of thinking, her approach was ineffective.\n\nSo, how could this person have better tried to persuade me to her beliefs?\n\n### Selling what people want\n\nUsing words like selling and advertising still make me feel a little dirty. I think because I see so much of it out there that I feel is against the common interest for humanity. But, if this is the prevalent system able to convince the masses to believe they want *product X*, then should we not consider leveraging it to promote what we believe in?\n\nTV advertising sounds a little out of date now, but before the internet's dominance, this was a key way for advertisers to sell to the audience. At least in the United States, some brodcasters used to be required to air some quantity of Public Service Announcements (PSAs). And these usually ended up being broadcast in the times with the least amount of viewers. Because - money.\n\n### Financial reasons\n\nWhat is the reason we aren't all working for Greenpeace or sharing the harvesting on a kibbutz? Is it our belief that we need an ever unattainable amount of money? Is that why we compromised and took the job with McBurgers. Maybe we believed it was just a temporary gig, so we could just get to a future state where we can live true to our beliefs? \n\nNaomi Klein's ""No Logo"" describes the big brand companies becoming ""lifestyle companies"", selling the companies image not only to the consumers, but also to their staff. Perhaps with enough colorful t-shirts, social mixers and corporate social responsibility projects, it is possible to keep staff content with not only some money, but also a belief that their sweatshop made products and hip software is for the common good. It did take me many years to walk away from the money (the belief in the products rarely lasted through the interview). I still earn a little from such a gig due to some of that self-compromising already mentioned, but with a clear plan to escape.\n\n### Telling friends what they don't want to hear\n\nWith friends, we have a bit more room to tell them what we think is good for them, that they wouldn't likely accept from a complete stranger. A bit more room, but not a carte blanche to force your beliefs on them.\n\nSo, your friend wants to buy a new gadget/car/muscial toothbrush. You want them to not want to do that. How could this be achieved?\n\n - telling them they're wrong and an evil person\n - giving them your gadget/car/musical toothbrush\n - do nothing and compromise a little more of yourself\n - educating them that their freedom to buy it has a real cost/impact on other people's freedoms\n\nThe last one sounds great, but is not an easy task. I've used the example of a friend, but this applies to your small tribe of family and social peers as well as to the greater and global community you live in. You don't want to be unfriended by the world, do you? Better to be wrong and have friends than the be the only sane person who lives alone in a cave.\n\nJust as killing someone who opposes what you believe in is an extreme reaction, so is doing nothing at all. Let's find somewhere around the middle of that dark-bright divide which is yin yang. \n\n### Same mistakes, bigger consequences\n\nPersuading people has been in our toolkit ever since we didn't want to keep killing the guy standing between us and the watering hole. Historical records of it go back as far as 2285 BC. \n\nOnce developed, one can use it for the benefit of others or for their own selfish goals, depending on which way their moral compass is being blown by the spiritual winds.\n\nNot much has changed in human behaviour since those early days of rhetoric, but the world we live in and our depletion of the life sustaining resources in it may now require those with a belief in sustaining life to up their powers of persuasion.\n\nEven if we achieve this great raising of awareness amongst humanity the day before a great meteor wipes us out, we'll at least have had that one day of beauty.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/6er3is/persuasion_for_humanity/

6elhrg,1496306897,Advice for Design/Architecture with a strong sustainability Focus?,"TL;DR at bottom.\n\nI'd like to get into design in sort of a broad sense, in the general realm of industrial design/architecture/urban planning, for sustainability/climate change efforts/environmental etc. I didn't know anything about these fields until recently, and am concerned it's too late for me (now 29, with a language BA and part of a film MFA). I've been working as a translator, being indecisive about what I want to do, feeling pulled in many directions. \n\nI feel a weird indescribable ""call"" to something in this general field of disciplines that I can't properly explain, which I've been ignoring for several years outside of a few small personal projects I've done. The vagueness of this post is, in part, me trying to figure out what's going on with that. To that end, does anyone have any ideas about what the best course for me might be? Either in terms of education or job prospects? What's out there? \n\nMight anyone have any resources for me for organizations, firms, etc. involved in these fields that have a very strong green bent, or a multidisciplinary approach, or are trying to lead the way in innovation or conceptual experimentation (I recognize this is vague and kind of silly sounding, I'm just trying to test the boundaries of the disciplines and see if there's stuff I haven't seen)? \n\nAre there any sorts of apprenticeships or internships I could do with no real experience to just figure out what I'm looking for?\n\nAre Masters in any of these fields worth anything without a prior Bachelor's degree or a really solid research objective? Can they ""substitute"" for a Bachelor's at all, in the sense of being like a Bachelor's with all the gen ed and elective courses removed? I've seen some conflicting opinions on the subreddits for the above-mentioned fields. I've also seen here and there that degrees focusing on sustainability in a general sense (which may have tracks oriented towards the disciplines I'm talking about, or an integrated, non-specialist approach) are kind of wishy-washy, how true is that?\n\nTL;DR: I'm youngish but getting kind of old for a total career change given my paucity of experience, but I feel an inexplicable call towards working in the design of our material environments as a means of getting involved in sustainability efforts that is getting increasingly difficult for me to ignore. I'm having a hard time getting a solid handle on what's out there and if school is a good idea or not.

6bndac,1495008384,Sustainability and computer science career?,"I'm currently graduating in computer science with a master's degree. However, in the last couple of months, I got really interested in sustainability, did some courses on this topic voluntarely and I'm generally interested in working in this field after my studies. But I'm not really sure how I could do this with a computer science degree - to me it seems that the IT industry isn't doing really good when it comes to sustainability. \n\nOne could argue that making technology and processes more efficient (which is basically what most people in IT are doing more or less) could be considered as sustainable, but I only see the rebound effect killing those efficency gains (the IT industry still is one of the fastest growing). \n\nNow I'm kind of in a dilemma. In my opinion the increasing proliferation of technology should be viewed way more critical than it currently is. There are some fields in which humanity might be profiting from technology (like the medical sector), but overall most technology creates unnecessary complexity in our daily lifes, decreases our privacy, creates a dependency on technology, wastes a lot of earth's ressources, makes us vulnerable to technology failures, ... short: it's not sustainable. \n\nAs my working life is just around the corner: Do you know any careers in computer science which might be covering the sustainability aspect? Or generally some intersections of sustainability and IT?",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/6bndac/sustainability_and_computer_science_career/

They were all feeling pretty down and wanted to know my opinion on what Trump might mean for renewables and the environment in general.\n\nExpecting a negative response I actually believe that it might not be as bad as everyone thinks.\n\nI pointed out that the Paris agreement was ratified in record time driven in part by the threat that Trump was a real candidate for President and might get elected and scuttle the whole deal.  So the rest of world rushed to sign as fast as possible - Thanks Donald.\n\nAlso the Federal Government has limited ability to influence energy policy - Trumps stance on issues like climate change, coal, and renewables has simply ignited a fire under the States that put energy policy into action resulting in accelerated mandates for clean energy (perhaps so they can give him the middle finger in a clean energy figurative kind of way!) - Thanks Donald.\n\nFinally - I think many of the sensible ""silent majority"" who see sustainability and a transition to renewables as just the smart thing to do have been given a wake up call that they cannot just sit silently watching this unfold and they have begun to wake from their slumber and join the conversation.  Perhaps Trump will wake the sleeping giant of sustainability and there really is a light at the end of the tunnel after all.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/625qje/could_trump_be_good_for_the_environment/

I’m very passionate about environmental sustainability and this is a problem I would absolutely dedicate my life to solve. And here I am trying to get started!\n\nThe next few decades will be a critical time for humanity, as a whole, to start making very necessary transitions to more sustainable sources of energy; for the sake of ourselves and the planet we live on. Fortunately, we’ve already gotten started in several countries. Unfortunately, this will be a slow process - before we’ve completely switched off fossil fuels - as large infrastructural changes take time to build, and this topic can be controversial politically (some of you may not think this is a problem at all). \nSo, as mediator solution, I wanted to work on a project that would very simply give the user the ability to be more conscious of their everyday energy usage and give them tools to reduce energy usage without interrupting their daily lives. I have an idea, some designs, and preliminary prototypes for a small device that might help do just that in terms of lighting and perhaps other simple electronics; but first I need some help from you guys to answer some questions. \n\nI’ve made an exhaustive survey of all the data I might need to validate my ideas and designs before I build anything. Not all these questions are required but please answer anything you can. All of it will be super helpful and might come back to you and the planet we live on in a good way!\n\nFeel free to ask any questions you may have in the comments!\n\nHere’s the [Survey]( https://goo.gl/forms/KgTSPDluG71M3Czs1)\n\ntl;dr I’m making a device that’ll allow you to cut back on your energy usage without interrupting your daily activities.

5yjysl,1489118304,[Meta] /r/transition,"**The Transition Movement is a global, grassroots campaign of communities working to transition away from dependence on non-renewable resources and environmental destruction to a new way of living with the earth.**\n\nbut why?\n\nPeople do Transition for all sorts of reasons:\n\nto get to know their neighbours;\nto feel like they are making a difference in the world;\nbecause the world’s huge challenges (climate change, social inequality, economic decline and so on) feel more manageable if addressed at the local scale (as one person put it, “Transition changed my relationship to the problems”);\nto catalyse all manner of new projects, enterprises and investment opportunities;\nto learn new skills;\nto feel like they are creating a new story for their place;\nto feel connected to other people and to something historic and exciting happening around them;\nbecause they feel it is “the right thing to do”.\n\n**Our principles**\n\nHead, Heart &amp; Hands\n\nDoing Transition successfully is about finding a balance between these:\n\nThe Head: we act on the basis of the best information and evidence available and apply our collective intelligence to find better ways of living.\n\nThe Heart: we work with compassion, valuing and paying attention to the emotional, psychological, relational and social aspects of the work we do.\n\nThe Hands: we turn our vision and ideas into a tangible reality, initiating practical projects and starting to build a new, healthy economy in the place we live.\nPrinciples\n\nTransition is an approach rooted in values and principles.  These are described slightly differently in different parts of the movement, but broadly:\n\nWe respect resource limits and create resilience – The urgent need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, greatly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and make wise use of precious resources is at the forefront of everything we do.\n\nWe promote inclusivity and social justice – The most disadvantaged and powerless people in our societies are likely to be worst affected by rising fuel and food prices, resource shortages and extreme weather events. We want to increase the chances of all groups in society to live well, healthily and with sustainable livelihoods.\n\nWe adopt subsidiarity (self-organisation and decision making at the appropriate level) – The intention of the Transition model is not to centralise or control decision making, but rather to work with everyone so that it is practiced at the most appropriate, practical and empowering level\n\nWe pay attention to balance – In responding to urgent, global challenges, individuals and groups can end up feeling stressed, closed or driven rather than open, connected and creative. We create space for reflection, celebration and rest to balance the times when we’re busily getting things done. We explore different ways of working which engage our heads, hands and hearts and enable us to develop collaborative and trusting relationships.\n\nWe are part of an experimental, learning network – Transition is a real-life, real-time global social experiment. Being part of a network means we can create change more quickly and more effectively, drawing on each other’s experiences and insights. We want to acknowledge and learn from failure as well as success – if we’re going to be bold and find new ways of living and working, we won’t always get it right first time. We will be open about our processes and will actively seek and respond positively to feedback.\n\nWe freely share ideas and power – Transition is a grassroots movement, where ideas can be taken up rapidly, widely and effectively because each community takes ownership of the process themselves. Transition looks different in different places and we want to encourage rather than unhelpfully constrain that diversity.\n\nWe collaborate and look for synergies – The Transition approach is to work together as a community, unleashing our collective genius to have a greater impact together than we can as individuals. We will look for opportunities to build creative and powerful partnerships across and beyond the Transition movement and develop a collaborative culture, finding links between projects, creating open decision-making processes and designing events and activities that help people make connections.\n\nWe foster positive visioning and creativity – Our primary focus is not on being against things, but on developing and promoting positive possibilities. We believe in using creative ways to engage and involve people, encouraging them to imagine the future they want to inhabit. The generation of new stories is central to this visioning work, as is having fun and celebrating success.\n\n**Why reddit?**\n\nwhy not! , this sites great for fostering discussion and we would love to hear from you! come take a peek at /r/transition",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/5yjysl/meta_rtransition/

5tnrdy,1486929662,sustainable development versus liberal point of view,"hello everyone. this is my first time here because i simply never thought about searching for a subreddit dealing with the concept of sustainability before now.\n\ni just finished my masters last november in sustainable development, environmental economics, and environmental management. i had two successful internships as a corporate social responsibility officer, and am actively searching for a stable job right now.\n\ni received an offer within an ngo who specializes in studies, events and groups in sustainability. basically i would be a an event/logistics manager for these events. and while i am an economist at heart, i am certain i can challenge myself and be up for the task if i put my mind into it.\n\nSO, i stalked the exective director's twitter to prepare myself for interviews, and he seems pretty active on social media. however i found out he is extremely liberal, and that annoyed me a bit since i more ""moderate"". meaning i knonw how to reason, be logical and apprehensive about a lot of current issues (immigrants and refugees for example) and don't let my heart or emotions decide for me.\n\nthat won't be a problem to me in work since i know how to adapt, keep to myself on issues, and because living in this world means living with opposite-minded people. (plus i need a job). BUT i did have a question for everyone here, and please i am genuinely not trying to stir shit. i would just like to see if **I** am sustainable in this field with my points of views.\n\n**does being in sustainable development means that i MUST be a liberal? can i be against refugees or against certain religions if i don't think they fit into the mold of the field?**\n\nas a corporate social responsibility officer, i know that i should promote diversity and equality of chances. but to me this furthers the concept of accepting anyone's application but only pursuing those who will fit in into my ecosystem. moreover, the whole concept of sustainability is smart reasonable allocation of resources over a certain territory. so why put more pressure and unneeded weight on one? finally, it is out duty to strengthen third world countries to make them stronger and let them retain their youth and minds INSIDE their own countries to keep the momentum going instead of draining the ""good"" out of a poor country and just keep encouraging immigration even more.\n\nthe point of this thread, is part self reassurance that i am really at one with my ""beliefs"" and sustainable development, and to maybe raise a debate or convo peacefully around the subject. thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/5tnrdy/sustainable_development_versus_liberal_point_of/

What's the best way for me moving forward?  \nHi sustainability, I hope this is the right sub for this!  \nSo I graduated last spring with a double major in economics and math. I really wish I had realized when I was picking schools and programs and things that this is what I want to do for a career, but I really only realized it once I decided to write my thesis on the alternative energy industry. Since graduating, i have been contracting (min wage) in a start up software project/product development team role for 5 months and living at home. It's really great experience and I'm not trying to quit this moment, but I'm trying to make plans towards a career (and ideally move out soonish).   \nMy absolute dream job would be to work with a green design or architecture company. obviously at the moment I'm totally open to doing work with any firm in the sustainability field, any entry level project job on linkedin, indeed, glassdoor, monster, etc require at least a bachelor's degree in sustainability and/or architecture and I have neither of those.    \nMy job-hunting plan is to send my resume to jobs that I'm qualified for (and some that I'm not) and just contact a ton of people on linked in / finding the company online and asking if they would be willing to have a 15-20 min informational interview.  \nI'm in the process of applying for some summer fellowships, studying for the gre, and applying to some jobs (but haven't buckled down to seriously start searching like that yet) - my question is, how feasible would it be for me to get a job in this area or do I need to put my efforts toward applying to get a degree or certification first? I want to get an MBA or masters in clean tech or sustainable design. But maybe there are other certifications that I don't know about?  \nThanks!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/5pt6b9/looking_to_work_in_the_green_architecturedesign/

5mlo83,1483811249,Confused on sustainable foods. It seems like 90% of the writing on eating for sustainability uses the wrong metrics.,"I'm finally coming around to the idea of giving up very unsustainable meats, but I wanted to see just how much of a difference it would make, so I started searching for some data. It seems like lots of people use [this report](http://static.ewg.org/reports/2011/meateaters/pdf/methodology_ewg_meat_eaters_guide_to_health_and_climate_2011.pdf) to demonstrate the difference between meat products and veggies, but then everyone cites these numbers in Kilo CO2/Kg food consumed. Last time I checked, I don't eat food by the Kg, I eat it by the calorie.\n\nHere's what I was thinking, everyone pretty much eats within 100 calories of their TDEE regardless of diet. If you're losing/gaining weight, you can do +/- 500 cals/day, but over the *long term*, even a 100 calorie swing would result in someone either being emaciated or morbidly obese (e.g. 160 lb 18 year old eats 100 extra calories per day, by 28 he's 260 lbs, 38 he's 360 lbs). Clearly in the long term we're eating right around our TDEE give or take 50-100 calories. Using this logic, we can predict our daily food intake to within 5%. So why aren't we using Kilo of CO2 per *calorie*? I only found a few websites listing this information, and it was very vague. I made a (very approximate) list of foods sorted by Kilo/calorie below. Most of my information comes from the report I linked above and comparisons of several calorie websites for each of the food items (obviously meats, especially red meat, were harder, because different cuts are different).\n\nFood| Kilo per kg | Calories per kg | Kilo per 2000 calories\n:--|:--|:--|:--\nMixed Nuts|2.3|6070|0.75\nPeanut butter|2.5|5880|0.85\nDry beans|2|3420|1.2\nLentils|0.9|1150|1.6\nRice|2.7|1300|4.2\nYogurt|2.2|960|4.6\nTofu|2|760|5.3\nChicken|6.9|2390|5.3\nEggs|4.8|1480|5.8\nCheese|13.5|590|7.5\nPotatoes|2.9|770|7.5\nMilk (2%)|1.9|500|7.6\nPork|12.1|2500|9.7\nCanned tuna|6.1|1160|10.5\nBroccoli|2|340|11.8\nTomatoes|1.1|180|12.2\nFarmed Salmon|11.9|1530|13.1\nTurkey|10.9|1530|14.2\nBeef|27|2000|27\nLamb|39.2|2300|34\n\nNow, I know this isn't the complete story. There are ethical considerations, varying practices among companies, countries, farms, and people. Some people may indeed eat fewer calories on a vegetarian diet, or they may eat more calories on a diet of straight peanut butter (though as I demonstrated above, not much more than a 5% difference in either direction over 10 years or so). There is also more to food than calories alone (I'm not telling you all to stop eating broccoli entirely, you'd have to eat a ton of broccoli/tomatoes to make a huge difference here), but overall it seems that we're overlooking the idea of creating and eating nutritionally dense foods. So why isn't this the gold standard on judging sustainable foods?",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/5mlo83/confused_on_sustainable_foods_it_seems_like_90_of/

I'd like to ask some other students, professors, people in the energy field, etc, questions. For example, what do you think should be standard on all campuses? trayless dining halls? Composting dining hall waste? Or what areas do you think colleges can make the most impact in? Energy, food, waste, transportation, lighting?\n\nPlease reply to this or send me a message! thanks! \n\n***Update***\n\nThank you all for the great replies, I have tried my best to get back to most. You really are helping me on my sustainability mission\n\n**more questions**\n\nWhat do you think is the best way to create change regarding sustainability on a campus?\n\nDo you know of/or are you part of a student government group that has faced/passed sustainability related issues?\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/5lbryd/looking_for_conversation_sustainability_on/

Search results frequently yield articles without many useful facts or mention of where the author obtained their information. I want quantitive information, like that found on nutrition labels, that can be used to quickly compare products and measure my impact on the planet. \n\nIn October I began collecting the information I found about product environmental impacts using an [open-edit wiki](http://wikifootprints.org/en/Main_Page) platform. The focus has been mostly on **quantitative information** about goods and services including:\n\n- Greenhouse gas emissions (carbon footprint)\n- Water consumption\n- Energy use\n- Material use\n\nThe goal is to facilitate quick comparisons between options and allow users to learn the effect a decision will have on a person’s overall impact on the environment. Additionally, we can prevent duplicate efforts by making the research, that many people may already be doing, publicly available for collaboration.\n\nThe wiki currently contains about 90 product and comparison pages. The [product pages](http://wikifootprints.org/en/Category:Product) provide a concise account of the environmental impact of a single product or service. These articles often detail how each stage of a product’s life cycle contributes to its overall environmental impact. The [comparison pages](http://wikifootprints.org/en/Category:Comparison) include tables that allow quick comparisons to be made between similar products.\n\nThe website uses the same software as Wikipedia, so it allows for collaborative editing. You are welcome to utilize the wiki and contribute citable information that others can use when making purchasing decisions.\n\nEdit: The URL is [wikifootprints.org](http://wikifootprints.org/en/Main_Page)\n\nTL;DR: Created an [open-edit wiki](http://wikifootprints.org/en/Main_Page) for product environmental impacts.

5gr42o,1481001593,"""If the most important environmental impact you wanted to alleviate was global warming, then you would go with plastic."" - David Tyler","Just read an interesting article interviewing a University of Oregon Chemistry Professor, David Tyler. The focus of the interview was on the life-cycle assessments of greenhouse gas emissions of plastic, paper, cotton, ceramic, owning a dog, buying local, and cloth diapers. Spoiler alert -- he says that plastic produces fewer GHG emissions than the above items. While I feel that his research focus was a little narrow (he focuses on GHG emissions only, not impact on health, animals, litter, etc.), he does make some interesting (and valid) points. I think the biggest takeaways from this article are -- (1) we need to evaluate the impact of our own practices (no matter what lifestyle you follow) with a critical eye and determine if our lifestyle meets the standards we are trying to achieve, and (2) if our lifestyle does not meet those standards, we should strive to change the way we live, change the products we buy, or take actions to change the way companies make these products. I encourage you to keep an open mind and check out [the article](https://cascade.uoregon.edu/fall2012/expert/expert-article/) for yourself. Summary is below, but **warning**, the explanations given in the article produces less of an eye rolling effect (from personal experience).\n\n\n\n**Summary as provided by author/interviewer:**\n\nTyler’s Top Ten Environmental Surprises\n\nLife-cycle assessments of our popular “green” consumer choices suggest we may be wise to consider alternatives as well. In some of these assessments, researchers have concluded:\n\n• Plastic bags produce FEWER greenhouse gases than paper or cotton bags.\n\n• Ceramic mugs consume MORE ENERGY than disposable cups.\n\n• The environmental impact of owning a dog CAN BE GREATER than owning an SUV.\n\n• Styrofoam cups produce FEWER greenhouse gases than paper cups.\n\n• Bioplastic forks CAN BE HARDER on the environment than plastic ones.\n\n• The BART system in the San Francisco area USES ABOUT AS MUCH ENERGY as commuters in cars.\n\n• Delivering a large truckload of tomatoes from California to Eugene can be EASIER ON THE ENVIRONMENT than delivering an equivalent amount in small truckloads from local farms.\n\n• Recycled paper CAN CONSUME MORE ENERGY than new paper (at least in England).\n\n• LED lights save energy but increase TOXICITY concerns.\n\n• Plastic diapers can be A GREENER CHOICE than cloth diapers.\n\n\n* X-post in /r/ZeroWaste*",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/5gr42o/if_the_most_important_environmental_impact_you/

I was lucky enough to get work at our campus Facilities Services, closely working with the cogeneration plant and campus sustainability. Through my time there, I had found passion in energy efficiency engineering, received a lot of training by the San Diego USGBC and LEED programs and wanted to get a career in sustainable energy. \n\nNow that I have graduated, I have been applying to jobs in the power and energy industry as well as the energy efficiency industry. I had received an offer to become an Distributions Engineer in MI, where sustainable energy is not exactly the top priority at the utility there, but it really is what I studied.\n\nSo, I understand that the experience working at utilities and an offer in the power industry is a huge opportunity. Now my question is: Is there potential advancements from working in utilities to getting into sustainable energy?  Should I take the job for working experience and find my way back into the energy efficiency field, or should I decline and continue looking for work that relates more toward energy efficiency training, i.e. working in HVAC, lighting, energy incentives, building management, etc.?",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/5frmg5/sustainability_careers_after_distribution/

58iw5b,1476992367,Groundwater Contamination,"Hello there, this is my first time posting here but I'll try to keep this post short:\n\nI am a student working at a university under an organization whose goal is to educate our peers about sustainable practices through interactive programs and activities. Currently I am working on a program that deals with water pollution and water usage.\n\nI remembered back in high school I took an AP Environmental Science course and we had a lab/interactive activity that dealt with groundwater pollution.\n\nThe YouTube link below shows a video where a teacher goes through a very similar lab/activity. It shows how pollution can happen to groundwater systems.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1txcrjH_Q2U\n\nThis was very interesting for me and I loved it a lot. I was planning to implement it for my program that focused on water pollution and water usage. But checking the price I saw that the machine itself was $100+.\n\nI'm wondering if there may be any way to recreate this activity using cheaper materials/equipment or if there are any other activities/labs out there that could do something similar. I really would like to do an activity that focuses on water pollution for my program.\n\nAny help is appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/58iw5b/groundwater_contamination/

5636p0,1475719781,Zero Waste Design Research,"Survey link: https://glenn55.typeform.com/to/A1YYtO\n\nHi Sustainable redditors!\n\nI’m a zero waste designer and researcher based in Wellington, New Zealand. I’m currently exploring materials and manufacturing processes to eliminate waste in how stuff is made.\n\nWe are sucking, digging, felling and taking resources from the earth at an increasing rate. Oil is predicted to last up until 2040, past that, it is an uncertain future. This means that at some point we will have no choice but to find other means to produce consumer items. By this time, it might very well be too late.\n\nWe are all trying to do our bit to help save the planet right now, but it isn’t quite working fast enough. Without zero waste systems implemented at the top of the spectrum, with big manufacturers of goods, wasteful consumer products are going to keep flying out of factories. Did you know that 80% of manufactured goods will be disposed of within the first 6 months of its life? This is a shocking statistic, as so many materials such as plastic can last forever.\n\nAs long as stuff is getting made, waste will continue to be generated. But that waste can be minimised or even eliminated through innovative zero waste processes. Yes plastic is bad, but now that so much of it has been made, there’s not much we can do about it apart from limiting the amount of new plastic being produced. 94% of resources extracted out of the ground becomes waste before any product even gets produced! Instead of drilling for oil, we should be mining landfills instead! Like all this plastic is just sitting there ready to make things out of.\n\nWe're in the process of designing a series of chairs that are icons of zero waste design and manufacturing. In doing so, We need to understand more about how you are implementing zero waste into your everyday lives. Linked above is a survey that shouldn't take more than 5 mins to complete (mostly multi-choice questions).\n\nI'd like to link you our facebook page also. Here you are able to follow our progress through this research project in designing a sustainable future.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/papertowns.co/?fref=ts\n\nThank you all,\n\nRegards,\nGlenn from the Papertowns team.\n\nSurvey link: https://glenn55.typeform.com/to/A1YYtO",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/5636p0/zero_waste_design_research/

I'm in the brainstorming stages of finding a research topic and I was wondering if you guys could throw some ideas out here.\n\nThe topic of of the course is ""Montreal as a human-natural system""\nMy own ideas so far:\n\n-Incentivizing  sustainable transport methods\n      Whats the cost of people using cars to come commute with, in terms of road maintenance, air quality, congestion. Using this cost, I would suggest an incentive program for people to use bikes, public transport, etc....maybe a law that only allows even/odd number license plates on different days into the central core? Mandatory car pooling?\n\n-Value of a tree in montreal:\n     What effects do parks, trees, greenspaces have on the health of people in montreal? Whats the value of a tree to the city of montreal in healthcare costs? Rates of diabetes, cancer etc. how can montreal best allocate new tree installment?\n\n-Residential housing expansion in montreal (land use intensity)l:\n      What is the human/environmental impact of residential expansion in montreal? How can residential housing best be located to minimize negative effects?\n\n-Something with green roofing/solar use?\n\nThese ideas are interesting to me but I feel like they have been done before, I'm looking for something original and at a small research scale (this is a group undergrad research project during just one semester).\n\nCheers!\n\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/529shb/urban_sustainability_research_ideas/

4z4bz5,1471920380,I need some information regarding land in the uk,"I have a small business that I earn enough to barely live right now, I live in London and rent costs are insane, and all in all I'm not as healthy as I once was, I can't afford to eat nicely like I used to because I have a limited budget after taking care of rent and utilities. I have been saving aside small amounts of money over time and I'm looking to buy some land and take my business off-the-grid so that I can enjoy my earnings and fund a better eating and healthier lifestyle... I have a problem though, right now I have limited funds, another month from now I will be sitting at approximately £16,000 in which I would like to use in purchasing a small piece of land, no planning permission required or anything special although if I could get something around 0.5 acres would be idea, however I don't know the costs that I'll be hit with outside of the initial purchase of the land, I've read up on things but I can't find more than the fact that I will be paying Land Tax, and I can't figure out what sort of price range that will be each year. I don't expect that I will be able to push forward with this right now with my budget but I've known people and read on reddit a few times of others doing more with almost half of my budget, also location isn't as important to me at this point... The idea is that I would be tethering internet from my mobile to my laptop where I do most of my work, and my laptop lasts 12hrs on a full charge which I have tested on solar power to charge and I have other sources of charging it too, for living I'd be sleeping in a converted van for a while so I just need somewhere I can literally park it and not having to pay rent would already increase what I can save towards something 'more' sustainable and enjoyable in the long run... I hope there is someone out there that can provide me with some good responses or reading material, I'm a real ""newbie"" at all of this stuff but I am very serious about it, I don't mind waiting even longer if I have to but I figured I would reach out and hope that someone who knows better may be able to give their advice or walk me through the details!

It is about finding better ways to create impact for people and the planet, to strengthen resilience and inclusive societies. It is about using the most up to date and best-fit models to get the best development result possible.*\n\n\nThe UNDP Innovation Facility’s second annual Review focuses on 62 initiatives across 45 countries sponsored by the Facility in 2015 with seed-funding and technical assistance. This includes Innovation Labs to improve public service delivery to foresight-based techniques that enhance planning processes; from real-time information that improves decision-making to behavioral insights that facilitate evidence-based policy-making. UNDP’s geographic reach, field presence and understanding of the local contexts, allows us to experiment with different innovation methods quickly and maximize the learning from those interventions that can be scaled up. This contributes to de-risking investment of public funds.\n\n\n\n**Check the link below to see UNDP's 2015 Year in Review and discover how innovation for development is a necessary driver for the Sustainable Development Goals!**\n\nhttp://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/development-impact/2015-year-in-review.html",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/4x03zk/when_innovation_meets_development_new_solutions/

4whbxy,1470511525,"What impacts sustainability more, population or consumption?","I've been having this debate with my sister, which started when I sent a link about population in Africa going to 4 billion, to which she is pretty adamant she thinks western consumption, like America's 4% population, 25% energy usage, is more impactful, and that population isn't an issue if we reduce our consumption.\n\nMy argument is:\n-40% of land today globally is used for agriculture and animal grazing for human consumption.  Yeah I'm sure western societies eat more beef and low-yield per acre crops like lettuce and berries, etc., but if we double population and keep the diet ratios the same, we will effectively need 2x as much land or way better yields.\n  -Humans are not going to start consuming rice, beans and avocado, so I don't see our land use for food not increasing in lock step with population.\n  -Land is extremely important, obviously, to sustainability of species, plants, etc.  To me this is the great definition of what is sustainable\n\n-Cutting down of forests for new home construction and home projects will increase more or less lock-step with population growth\n  -We are not going to all of a sudden stop building new homes using wood, putting in decks, building wood boats, etc.\n\n-Most of our infrastructure is built already. I.e. homes, buildings, distance between cities, etc.\n  -We can power cars, trains, homes and buildings on solar energy which is more efficient than oil/coal/etc., but ultimately solar panels takes a lot of energy to create\n-People aren't going to voluntarily build smaller homes going forward, and anyhow each new home is new demand for energy!\n\n-People simply aren't looking to downgrade their lifestyle.\n  -Nobody is going to stop taking flights, roadtrips, etc.  Nobody is rushing to convert their home into a 2 family to save on energy.\n  -In the first, second and third world, quality of life is only looking to go up.  If africa, south and central america ever get economic success like the West and China, watch consumption skyrocket!\n\n-Other than people going veg, and solar becoming universal, I don't think we could double population and keep consumption the same.\n\n-Population and the limit of natural resources are the only thing imo that can curb consumption, and one of those is basically just saying ""you've run out"" or ""we have to start rationing or else we'll be fked.""  \n\n-Maybe population controls like 1 or 2 child maximums will never be able to pass legislation in the western world, but I think there is even less likelihood of taxing meat and dairy to the point where people stop consuming it in droves; and if you know about meat and dairy you'd know it is BY FAR the largest contributor to global emissions.\n\nWe are honestly probably fked.  But just for theory sake, I propose this argument.  We could def reduce populations through child limit laws, but i don't think we can halve consumption, which we'd have to do if we double population, to even stay on the disastrous emissions trajectory we're on.\n\n\n\n\nIf TLTR; I think only way to make earth sustainable for humans and all other species is to institute child limit laws.  My sister thinks we can reduce consumption, and that population, especially in 3rd world countries where the pop growth is high, isn't the issue.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/4whbxy/what_impacts_sustainability_more_population_or/

4w4j6m,1470317826,How high would a sustainable carbon budget be?,"Every animal on earth has two aspects in common: they require energy (in the form of food) and they produce carbon dioxide as waste product.\n\nMost of nature is limited by available energy and doesn't need to care about their waste products as a result. But for humans, energy is almost infinitely easy to come by. So we need to be concerned about our waste products, especially the two that are causing concern right now: carbon dioxide and methane.\n\nBecause all animals emit greenhouse gases, there must be carbon sinks in the ecosystem that kept the overall level constant for the previous couple of millenia. But I couldn't find how powerful these sustainable carbon sinks are. If I knew, I could calculate a sustainable carbon budget for the whole human population.

4s7t9v,1468190617,"Aristotle, da Vinci, Darwin, .... Malthus??","Aristotle, Da Vinci, Darwin, … Malthus??\nHuman societies have been shaped by surges in intellectual advances often spurred by single individuals.  Some are revered and some are forgotten but Aristotle, Da Vinci and Darwin stand pretty much in a league of their own.  The way we humans think about ourselves and our world through physics, philosophy, and social lenses was changed by these intellectual giants.  \n\nBut there is one name yet to be added.  Thomas Malthus dealt with difficult questions of human nature and his teachings have yet to be applied.  Malthus was the first sustainability guru in western society.\n\nNot so Aristotle whose intellectual range was vast, covering most of the sciences and many of the arts.   He was the founder of formal logic and his work remains a powerful current in contemporary philosophical debate.\n\nThen there was Leonardo da Vinci, whose genius as a painter, draftsman, sculptor, architect, and engineer, perhaps more than that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal.  His notebooks reveal a spirit of scientific inquiry and a mechanical inventiveness that were centuries ahead of their time.\n\nCharles Darwin was a naturalist whose scientific theory of evolution by natural selection became the foundation of modern evolutionary studies.  The new evolutionary narrative rapidly spread through all of science, literature, and politics and profoundly changed the way humans viewed themselves and the world around them.\n\nIn contrast to these timeless greats, Thomas Malthus is now little more than an arcane historical footnote, not widely studied yet regularly panned by the economic establishment.   However, Darwin and many scientists found inspiration in Malthus’ writings even as they were spurned by the commercial world.\n\nWhereas Darwin, da Vinci and Aristotle opened our minds to a world of wonder, a world of progressive change for all, Malthus held forth a view which presented difficult choices.  And these difficult choices required significant sacrifices by the powers of the day. \n \nMalthus laid out the principle causes of societies failure down through the ages, an immeasurably valuable revelation of cause and effect.   Malthus was an observer of history and was the first to try and explain past events in history through the application of logic and mathematics.  Yet he has been ignored and even ridiculed by commercial and political elites which rightly saw his concepts as direct threats to their own prosperity and power.\n\nHe noted:\n-	The inevitability of repeated social collapse given the human tendency to reproduce.\n-	The surges in population and collapses of societies through history\n-	The very high rates of population growth in new lands\n-	The impossibility of sustaining high rates of growth\n-	The inequality in industrial development and social structure\n-	The food inefficiency of meat production\n-	See more of population cycles and historical graphs here;  \n-	http://sustainablesociety.com/population/population-cycles#.V4LNjaJdPSg\n\nMalthus called for an end to growth, higher real wages, reductions in inequality and an economic focus on providing material sustenance for the poor rather than luxury goods for the rich.  In effect he proposed more wealth and power to the middle class and a reduction in poverty all the while removing a good part of the means of wealth accumulation for the rich. (cheap labour and asset inflation)\n\nThe nobility of late 18th century England were no more open to hearing Malthus’ proposals than todays bankers, media corporations, developers and cheap labour employers are of hearing about sustainability, a broad based economy or the re-writing of globalism with new humanist based goals.  Hence the attacks from every point of the elite compass to halt the spread of this kind of conversation.\n\nThis is a huge loss for humanity because the intelligence which Malthus contributed to public discussion was different in nature for those of the other three icons.  Instead of lifting humanity up to new heights of moral or technical understanding, Malthus illuminated what it would take for human societies to endure.  By analyzing the reasons for the repeated failure of civilizations, Malthus opened the door to finding the path not previously travelled, the one which circumvents population cycles and reveals the mechanism of sustainability.\n\nWhere Aristotle clarified thinking on philosophy and advanced many forms of science through the process of logic, Da Vinci inspired that world of science and the love of form and Darwin utterly transformed our understanding of geological and biological time and processes, Malthus showed the key flaws in humanity’s attempt to build permanent progress and social stability.\n\nHumanity does not lack for technological cleverness or the drive to improve or to learn about the world around us.  What humanity lacks is an understanding of why our societies repeatedly fail and what changes we must make to assure that we can cross the threshold to both stability and progress.\n\nThe other greats gave society the ability to make great strides forward.  Malthus, if applied, would allow our societies to stop sliding back repeatedly.   If the teachings / research / findings / conclusions of Malthus had been followed allowing humanity to avoid the wars, famines, plagues and societal upheavals that are part and parcel of every population cycle, it would have marked the greatest advance in human history since the development of agriculture and the formation of towns.  \n\nA way for towns and higher order societies to progress steadily without collapse.  It would make eternal progress possible rather than dooming society to inevitable failure with the impossible pursuit of eternal growth. \n\nThe findings of Darwin were a direct contradiction of core religious teachings and thus ran into huge criticism from many quarters.  However, Malthus’s suggestions advocated a fundamental change in social priorities, wealth creation and distribution.  A direct attack on the wealthy, their pocketbooks and their pride and their power.  \n\nHence, his proposals were much more of a challenge to the social order elites have profited from throughout time than even Darwin’s “On the Origin of Species” was to the church of the day.\n\nYes, Malthus will be repeatedly held out as a failed prophet by the growth addicted elites but they will always fail to mention the accuracy of his historical observations, the undeniability of his mathematics and the fact that simply because our modern cycle has not collapsed does not mean that we are not in a cycle.\n\nMalthus looked at regional and national population cycles to the limit of the data available to him over 200 years ago.  Today, we are in a global cycle composed of many smaller interlocked national ones.  \nHowever, the data we have available to us now stretches back thousands of years with detail and extent that Malthus could never have dreamed of.  All of this supports his contentions and should give us cause along with the social micro-fracturing currently appearing in most countries, to embrace his cautions and deal with the issues of population and consumption in ways that have simply never been possible before in human history.\n\nIf we can do that, then Malthus may yet be elevated to his rightful place beside the illustrious greats of humankind.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/4s7t9v/aristotle_da_vinci_darwin_malthus/

Example: For veggies or fruits I just don't bother bagging 3-4 apples for instance or a head of lettuce.\n\nThe problem starts when I need 10 apples or a mix of nuts for instance, because then I will have to bag those items.\n\nSo here's my question: Do you guys know a practical solution for this when going to regular groceries stores? Knowing that those items would be weight so I cannot use heavy materials to bag those items.\n\nIs there such a material that would be perfect for me to use?\nIf there is, where can I find it?\n\nThanks guys!",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/4pb4wo/how_to_skip_the_use_of_clear_grocery_bags/

4p0xd2,1466455911,Best Sustainable Habits?,"Hey guys!\nWe're working on making a large list of everyday sustainability tactics that we can implement into our lives. We're looking for both big and small suggestions, ones we might already know, and ones we may not have heard of. Below are some examples to get the list rolling -- please comment and add to this it. Your help is much appreciated, and maybe you'll find some ideas in here as well!\n\n#1 Always have a reusable coffee/tea thermos in your bag, car, backpack, etc. This is a very easy way to reduce non-recyclable cup waste! Plus, many places will give you the price of a small for the quantity of a large because you're not costing them a cup. All in all this is a huge win.\n\n#2 Invest in well made, durable grocery bags. We've all seen the .70 cent plastic-ish reusable bags at trader joes, whole foods, and other stores. In reality, a majority of those bags bust and get thrown away after only a few uses. I've found bags for $3.50 I've been able to use for months, hopefully they last me for years, I'll let you guys know.\n\n#3 Get reusable produce bags for your grocery store trips. Has anyone else realized how unnecessary the bunches of tiny plastic bags that are specifically used to separate produce are? There are now reusable ones! The ones I found are made of a combination of net and a bag. They're easy to remember because you can just stick them in your shopping bag once you unload everything into the fridge.\n\n#4 Carry a reusable spork with you! Down with the one-time use plastic spoons, forks, knives that come with so many to-go lunches. Re-usable, durable plastic sporks are a great solution to this problem, and they're super easy to carry in your purse, bag, car, or work desk.\n\n#5 Commit to tupperware, and never use a plastic baggie again. This one is kind of hard, because plastic wrap and baggies have been a part of our lives since childhood, but they really are so unnecessary when you have tupperware. You can put almost anything in tupperware products, and use them for decades!\n\nNow we turn the list over to you guys. Any suggestions? Comments? Hope you all enjoyed this!",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/4p0xd2/best_sustainable_habits/

But the polar ice caps melting is causing flooding all over the world and in not very much time many people's homes will be covered (many already have had to rehome).  This is something that is not very widely discussed, which is worrying.  Obviously beef makes a lot of money, if we think about how much must be used on a single day by the likes of McDonald's.  Any way, many people take the mindset of not worrying about these issues, saying it won't matter this century - it will.  What I'm trying to say in this post is that it is better to see all the bad things in this fucked up world for what they are, rather than pretend like it's all OK.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/4l4g02/see_it_for_what_it_is/

From what I understand basically everything that American citizens do is unsustainable and for this reason my life has been overcome by guilt due to my understanding of the environmental and social consequences that all of my actions have. I am a vegan, I don't have a car, and I try to avoid waste at all costs but sometimes it is impossible. Every time I go out to eat and I have to throw away some paper or plastic I feel so guilty that the entire experience is ruined. I want to get a computer but I can't because I know that eventually the computer will be in the ground and that it's creation required others to suffer. I always feel like my actions aren't good enough for my values to the point where I feel like I have to live as a nomad and live with no personal belongings if I am to feel like I am really doing the right thing. I try to limit my hobbies to those that don't require me to purchase a lot of goods but even buying a new book makes me feel like I am putting what I want over what someone else has equal rights to. I try to buy everything second hand and sell anything that I no longer want, but this is still a form of participation in a system that I do not really support morally. Why should I have the luxury of getting to drift through life consuming at the expense of others until I die? Should I even care this much?

We're currently debating whether to continue not using trash can liners or not.\n\nFor the record, I think this is a totally absurd debate and wastes a lot of time we could be spending on other more important issues — like how much solid waste we produce. But it is also one that is symbolic of my co-op's preference for decisions that *appear* sustainable over choices that *actually* improve sustainability.\n\nSo, help me out. I know that trash can liners are capable of substantially reducing blow-away litter. It also seems that they should make waste disposal a much safer and more sanitary job for city employees. But I can't find many reliable sources of information on the topic. No one seems to have studied this question.\n\nHalp, pls.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/4hoj92/eliminating_trash_can_liners_good_or_bad/

4gga2d,1461629980,Looking into potentially building a partially underground house to curb our insane heating needs in Canada. Has anyone done this or does anyone know some good places to gather information? (Xpost from r/SelfSufficiency),"My husband and I bought a 19 acre piece of land last winter. Originally we had a 2000+ square foot house drawn up. Then we decided that even though we could technically do it, we didn't want to tie all of our money up in a house plus try to heat/cool and maintain that much space. It's just the two of us and always will be. Then we moved on and drew up an adorable 681 square cabin type with a loft. It absolutely suites our needs, but we had another idea that we're considering. Our lot consists of 17 acres of forest and 2 cleared acres. The cleared acres are on the south side of a hill. Pretty much perfect for a partially buried house from my understanding. We have always wanted to keep the yard looking as natural as possible and this would definitely accomplish that. We also wanted to do solar, but with the heating needs of a traditional house it wasn't feasible. Could it be possible with an underground house now? We are wanting a wood fireplace or wood stove to help with heating. We had been thinking of building the underground walls with ICF blocks so they are strong and insulated right from the start. We know it's a more costly option but if the house is small enough it would work. Our soil is mostly a clay type, which I don't think is ideal but could it work? We're just looking for any suggestions or insight at this point to see if this is feasible. We're hoping to minimize our need for monthly hydro bills and to keep our yard looking natural. We absolutely love our forest and hope to make as small of footprint as comfortably possible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/4gga2d/looking_into_potentially_building_a_partially/
