e4sb8m,1575254375,"Not sure if this is allowed here, but I’ve created a subreddit for discussion and support of the Whale Sanctuary Project - We are r/whalesanctuary, check us out!","r/whalesanctuary \n\n———\nWhy a whale sanctuary?\n———\n\nAnimals that have been in captivity for most of, if not their entire, lives cannot be expected to be able to sustain themselves independently in the wild. A sanctuary for these animals will give them an environment 300-400 times the size of the biggest known tank, the opportunity to swim freely in straight lines, hunt and forage for their own food, socialize naturally, and interact with the natural world. \n     For a lot of these animals, moving to a sanctuary would be the first opportunity they’ve had to feel the ocean, to see live fish, to experience tides, rub against rocks, and everything else a wild animal should be able to able to experience.\n\n———\nThe Whale Sanctuary Project\n———\n\n    There are currently over 50 experts working on the Whale Sanctuary Project, spanning multiple professions and areas of interest. The Whale Sanctuary Project is the first organization solely dedicated to creating seaside sanctuaries in North America for whales, dolphins, and porpoises who are being retired from the entertainment industry, or animals who have been rescued from the wild and need rehabilitation or permanent care. This facility would be the first of it’s kind, and a huge step in removing the animals currently in captivity from their current situation. Conservation is, of course, very important, but this project is about restoring something we humans so selfishly have taken from these highly intelligent, socially complex creatures by forcing them to live in captivity for our entertainment. If there are no sanctuaries built, these animals are destined to continue performing until they die. \n     Instead of the concrete walls of a tank, the animals released into the sanctuary will live in a dynamic and complex world ready for them to interact with. The sanctuary will be in a netted-off area such as a bay or a cove. All of the proposed sites have over 100 acres (484,000 sq. yards) with an average depth of 50 feet (15 meters) throughout. that’s over 400 times the size of the largest display tank at a high-end marine park. \n     There will be rigorous environmental impact studies to be sure the sanctuary will have no negative effects on the wildlife already calling the area home.  The first phases of development would include the enclosure barriers, infrastructure, lab, medical and sanitation services, food prep services, security, and animal care facilities. Future phases would provide opportunities for internships, visitors centers, and the type of equipment needed to enhance our educational outreach, such as underwater cameras and hydrophones.\n     Depending on the location chosen and the kind of infrastructure needed to be built, a rough estimate for the cost of a sanctuary would be around $20 million. The long-term care of the facility and the animals would be payed through endowments, sustaining donations, and other revenue-generating opportunities, such as educational materials and programs. The project was launched with a $200,000 donation from Munchkin, Inc., the global baby product company. The company has pledged a total of at least $1 million towards the completion of the sanctuary.\n\n———\nHow can we help?\n———\n\nKeep the conversation going - on social media, with friends and family, at school and in the workplace. Social media is quickly becoming the stage in which effective change happens. Encourage everyone you know NOT to buy a ticket to MarineLand, SeaWorld, or any other marine park that exhibits these animals. On the website,  https://whalesanctuaryproject.org, you can donate directly to the cause, and also sign up for a newsletter that will keep you updated on the progress being made. The team is always looking to add people whose skills can contribute to the cause.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/e4sb8m/not_sure_if_this_is_allowed_here_but_ive_created/

We need a fresh look at  how we are going to  actually address the issues, be it through the  design of products,  consumer awareness, waste management, and ocean  cleanup.\n\nThere simply is no magic bullet, ocean vacuum, or bio-plastic that will do it all.\n\nLink to video here:  [It's Time to Do Something About Ocean Plastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ390qK6Ga0)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/dyo5wo/its_time_to_do_something_about_ocean_plastic/

They say lithium overexploration is destroying small villages and country sides all over the world and after the batteries are dead they will be disposed and hurt the environment.\n\nWhat I don't understand about this argument is: petrol cars also have batteries, not as big or as much, but they do, which means they contribute to the lithium exploration. Of course I don't agree with over exploring this resource, but I really don't see how do electric cars make it so much worse. And comparing with all the other environmental problems with petrol, isn't it still a better solution for the mobility part of the environment?\n\nI'd appreciate some clarification from this sub, or even a reference to some article about this.

Fly business class - Probably take the most revenue from the airline (you use a seat that they could have sold), reducing profitability and potentially reducing the expansion of airline growth.\n3.

cuutgy,1566660799,How could you support the green new deal?,"Unfortunately as someone still on Facebook I am bombarded with friends and family touting this green new deal that’s being pushed around. The claim by people like AOC and Bernie is that we only have 12 years left to do something.\n\nIf that is the case and if that is true, why does this deal not only support nuclear but actively wants to shut them down? Currently nuclear and wind and hydro are the only true clean energy sources we have actively working right now as solar relies on a lot of mining for rare elements not to mention for it to work at night it would need to save the energy in insanely massive battery stores made of more earth destructing materials we would need to mine.\n\nGiven the above there are 589 power plants today in operation in the United States. These power plants are mostly in the northeastern part of the United States. If you wanted to move to solar there it would mean massive deforestation to clear way for massive solar farms. \n\nAside from the physical aspect looking at cost, the average coal plant produces 500mw of energy with nuclear plants generating near 2,000 mw or about 4 times the average coal plant. \n\nThis means 147 nuclear plants could replace every single coal plant in America. With an average cost to build of $5 billion, that is 736 billion dollars, just a fraction of the 16 trillion it is estimated to cost to move to wind/solar.\n\nNot only is the cost a fraction of the price, this is something realistically that can be done today. Not 10 years from now, today.\n\nGiven when you look at the real facts not just the politician provided ones. Why are people like Bernie and AOC actually pushing this new deal which would require massive technological advances in battery density and massive destruction in terms of deforestation and mining when we could actually replace coal with nuclear today?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/cuutgy/how_could_you_support_the_green_new_deal/

cnewg4,1565228596,"Climate Denying politicians are loosing ground, lets pull their supporters away from them!","[https://observer.com/2019/07/climate-change-republicans-conservative-solution/](https://observer.com/2019/07/climate-change-republicans-conservative-solution/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is imperative that we speak with conservative and independent voters about just how dangerous climate change is, because the evidence is becoming less and less deniable and the politicians attempting to deny it can no longer use the same arguments they did years ago. Their greedy motives are becoming increasingly obvious to the conservative voters that were once loyal to them. We need to take advantage of this!\n\nWhat we need to realize is most republicans that didn't believe that climate change was real in the past 50 years held that belief because the media and politicians they listen to hid and still hide the truth for them. Now climate change is becoming increasingly undeniable with the overwhelming visual evidence. We need to approach conservative voters and give them the grim truth about climate change. Tell them their children's future is in danger if they keep voting for these climate change deniers. Tell them that the politicians know that climate change is real, they just pretend it's not a problem because they're just greedy old men. Climate change is an issue that has the power to break many conservatives loyalty in the politicians and media they once listened to. Even if you don\]t convince them to vote for someone who will take action, you may break their faith in politics enough that they don't vote at all, which still takes away a vote from conservatives.\n\nMore importantly think of it this way, if only 5% of the 64% of those republicans care enough to take action, that 5% could be very important in convincing the other 59% to take action.\n\nFor example think of a mostly republican neighborhood, it's sort of an echo chamber where the same opinions are held throughout the community. You're friends with one of those neighbors, you respectfully debate with them about climate change and you win him over by talking about his clild's future if we don't take action. Without ever entering this conservative neighborhood, your words created an advocate for climate change in a place where nobody cared about it. The man you talked to has the respect of the rest of the neighborhood, therefore they can spread the news about climate change in a neighborhood that once refused to even talk about the environment because they thought it was a ""liberal only"" issue. This neighborhood was once 100% conservative and didn't believe in climate change at all. Your friend managed to convince many of his neighbors that climate change was at least real. Before he talked to the neighborhood 90% of them were ready to go out and vote for trump and other climate denying politicians, but now only 50% are passionate, 25% are indifferent and 25% no longer have faith in them.\n\nThis example was simply a hypothetical. Obviously not every person we convince will be this effective at convincing others, but that being said there is also the chance you can convince somebody that climate change is important and that person becomes an extremely active advocate for the cause.\n\nTLDR ;\n\nThis is a topic that I will continue to talk about to my fellow climate activists throughout the 2020 elections because I feel that many of us tend to ignore our conservative neighbors. When advocating for climate change action, it is imperative that we do not limit our discourse to just fellow progressives and environmentalists. Conservative voters are becoming increasingly aware that climate change isn't fake. We can use this fact to our advantage in taking down the climate denying politicians who are losing their influence due to the evidence of climate change!\n\nUse Trump and other climate denying politician's policies against them when talking to republicans voters about climate change. Tell them that their clildren's futures are in peril due to the denial and inaction of the politicians they once were loyal to. Tell them that they never intended to make america great again, they just wanted to kill it and milk it for all it's worth. Trump doesn't care about you, he only cares about himself. Tell them that his charismatic rhetoric was only to win them over, and that it's not too late to reverse the damage he's done.\n\nTogether is how we should take Trump and other climate denying politicians down. Divided is how they win.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/cnewg4/climate_denying_politicians_are_loosing_ground/

I’m curious if there’s a website or shops I can buy in bulk to where costs even out.

cmd40i,1565022121,Would you be interested to know which restaurants around you are environmentally sustainable?,"Hi Reddit, I have recently launched a competition and a website ([Athenum.io](https://athenum.io/) ) to understand how restaurants can be more sustainable for the environment and support local economies. And when I say restaurants it is in the broadest sense, including cafes and takeaways too.\n\nAs a company we want to evaluate businesses by how sustainable they are to the environment using data, and we are starting with restaurants as that includes complex supply chain that can be hard to see as a customer. I believe that simply changing the individual habits will not be enough to solve the pollution and climate change issues, but the businesses need to be accountable and do their part as well. Creating incentives for the businesses to adopt sustainable practices could help more than just shaming them. And I am sure that many people would care about having lower impact on climate and chose to purchase sustainable services and goods especially if that doesn't compromise the quality of experience.\n\nI am interested to know what do you think about this and if you would like to hear more. Also would you use such information to decide where to go? If you are already running a sustainable restaurant, what are you currently doing to promote it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/cmd40i/would_you_be_interested_to_know_which_restaurants/

cf3ar3,1563512396,5 Reasons Why TerraGreen Supports Renewable Energy?,"  \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/28h14buzw6b31.jpg\n\n• It is safe, abundant, and clean to use when compared to fossil fuels. \n\nEven clean-burning natural gas is at a disadvantage to what renewable energy sources can provide. Enough sunlight comes down on our planet every day that if we could harvest it with solar panels and other forms of collection, we could power everything for an entire year. Because wind is created by the warmth of the sun, it is also virtually limitless. Fossil fuels, in theory, are a finite resource because of how they are created.\n\n• Multiple forms of renewable energy exist. \n\nDiversification within the renewable energy sector has exploded since the 1970s. From dams that provide hydropower to solar strips that are strong enough to handle the weight of a vehicle and can be turned into roads, we have numerous methods of creating power through the collection of renewable energy. There is greater diversity in this sector when compared to fossil fuel resources.\n\n• It provides the foundation for energy independence. \n\nMany nations rely on fossil fuels for their society to function under the “modern” definition. These fuels come from a handful of countries that work to control pricing and availability. By developing renewable energy resources, countries can work toward energy independence with a diversified portfolio of energy to access. Although these resources take time to develop, it should be remembered that the current fossil fuel infrastructure has more than a century of development behind it.\n\n• Renewable energy is stable. \n\nWhen renewables are creating energy, the power produced is stable and usable, just like any other form of “traditional” power. It is a dependable resource when an infrastructure is available to support it. Jobs are created within the sector as well, creating stability within local economic sectors at the same time. The power created can be distributed through existing grids, which can limit installation costs for some communities.\n\n• It is a technology instead of a fuel. \n\nCoal must be mined and refined to make it useful. Natural gas must be released and transported. A fossil fuel is created from natural resources, whereas renewable energies are created thanks to the use of technology. For this reason, the pricing of renewable energies will continue to go down as improvements in technology occur. Fossil fuels can see price reductions through mining and refining efficiency improvements, but there will always be an underlying labor cost that will affect pricing and availability.\n\n**Visit us:**\n\n[https://www.terragreen.io/](https://www.terragreen.io/)\n\n[http://ico.terragreen.io/](http://blockchain.terragreen.io/)\n\n[https://wallet.terragreen.io/](https://wallet.terragreen.io/)\n\n[http://blockchain.terragreen.io/](http://blockchain.terragreen.io/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/cf3ar3/5_reasons_why_terragreen_supports_renewable_energy/

One of the largest reasons our environment is suffering is because of the incredible yet terrible mass wasting of electricity. Households all across the world waste electricity by leaving electronics on standby, leaving lights and fans on, using dishwashers and washing machines inefficiently and overusing heating and AC. And in this process, hundreds of dollars is given away to electric companies every year in every household! This issue is so relevant and important, I decided to make a video on it.

c03jx0,1560417295,investigation of the atomic catastrophe in the USSR in 1957 (Not Chernobyl)," \n\nAfter World War 2, the Soviet Union lagged behind the U.S. in development of nuclear weapons, so it started a rapid research and development program to produce a sufficient amount of weapons-grade uranium and plutinium. The Mayak plant was built in haste between 1945 and 1948. Gaps in physicists' knowledge about nuclear physics at the time made it difficult to judge the [safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_safety) of many decisions. Environmental concerns were not taken seriously during the early development stage. Initially Mayak was dumping high-level radioactive waste into a nearby river, which flowed to the river Ob, flowing farther down to the Arctic Ocean. All six reactors were on Lake Kyzyltash and used an open-cycle cooling system, discharging contaminated water directly back into the lake. When Lake Kyzyltash quickly became contaminated, Lake Karachay was used for open-air storage, keeping the contamination a slight distance from the reactors but soon making Lake Karachay the ""most-polluted spot on Earth"".\n\nIn 1957 the cooling system in one of the tanks containing about 70–80 tons of liquid radioactive waste failed and was not repaired. The temperature in it started to rise, resulting in evaporation and a chemical explosion of the dried waste, consisting mainly of ammonium nitrate and acetates. The explosion, on 29 September 1957, estimated to have a force of about 70–100 tons of TNT, threw the 160-ton concrete lid into the air. There were no immediate casualties as a result of the explosion, but it released an estimated 20 MCi (800 PBq) of radioactivity. Most of this contamination settled out near the site of the accident and contributed to the pollution of the Techa River, but a plume containing 2 MCi (80 PBq) of radionuclides spread out over hundreds of kilometers. Previously contaminated areas within the affected area include the Techa river, which had previously received 2.75 MCi (100 PBq) of deliberately dumped waste, and Lake Karachay, which had received 120 MCi (4,000 PBq).\n\nOn October 6, 1957, the following article appeared in the Chelyabinsk Worker newspaper:\n\n“Last Sunday evening ... many Chelyabinsk residents observed a special glow of the starry sky. This rather rare glow in our latitudes had all the signs of the aurora. Intense red, sometimes turning into a slightly pink and light blue glow at first covered a large part of the southwestern and northeastern surface of the sky. At about 11 o'clock it could be observed in the northwestern direction ... Against the sky, relatively large colored areas appeared and, at times, quiet bands that had a meridional direction at the last stage of the aurora. The study of the nature of auroras, begun by Lomonosov, continues in our days. In modern science, Lomonosov’s main idea was confirmed that aurora occurs in the upper layers of the atmosphere as a result of electrical discharges ... Auroras ... can be observed further in the latitudes of the Southern Urals. ”\n\nToday the river should be already clean, after more than 60 years have passed, but ... [There are a lot of videos on the Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLy7mDVnebU), as people who live there make measurements that show the excess of norms hundreds of times.\n\n"" Most auroras occur in a band known as the ""auroral zone"", which is typically 3° to 6° wide in latitude and between 10° and 20° "" (wiki) it means, This means that the northern lights may be no farther than 20 degrees from the pole. Chelyabinsk is at 45 degrees.\n\nOkay, may be its miracle, okay.....

bwoukt,1559655795,Waze Carpool App,"A month ago I was searching to see if there were any good methods for arranging a carpool. I drive quite a long commute and I was trying to find a way to save money on gas and tolls.\n\nI just recently discovered Waze has a carpool function and also a completely separate app called Waze Carpool. \n\nPeople looking for rides can find someone along their route who will pick them up and bring them to work. You negotiate a price with the driver, anywhere from $0-$15 depending on what you think is fair. For example if I barely had to go out of my way to pick someone up I’d probably offer to do it for $5 but if it’s gonna add 20min to my drive I’d be more likely to send an offer over $10. \n\nIt’s exactly what I was looking for, with the exception that it’s still very new so there aren’t enough users signed up yet for it to really be viable.\n\nThat being said, they have a lot of incentives to join right now because of that. For instance, if you use the promo code THEMI3GoUH you will get $20 as a bonus just for trying it once. And this is not $20 with strings attached. You’ll be able to withdraw that money the next month. Additionally if you commute in the DC area they seem to be running another promo that lets riders commute anywhere for just $2 this month. I usually drive so I haven’t tested that one out yet.\n\nAnyway I’m hoping other people are as excited about this app. Could mean a lot fewer cars on the road and that’s something Baltimore and DC desperately needs.\n\n[$20 Free on first ride - THEMI3GoUH ](https://www.waze.com/carpool/referral?a=redeem_referral&amp;referral_token=tk.15bc8276-ff86-4130-9aac-58b0eb14777e)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/bwoukt/waze_carpool_app/

That can reduce GHG emissions and  mitigate waste pollution.  \n\n\nOur intention is to break down the  walls between energy producers, consumers, investors, and utilities. So  that people will involve in it and get to know in detail regarding the  production of their energy.  \n\n\nTo the point, TerraGreen’s main  purpose is to create a sustainable and clean community which allows  customers to participate in renewable energy hastily.  \n\n\nWith TerraGreen people or users will stay connected to each other and will have clear information on the use of their energy.  \n\n\nWe  have introduced a platform coin known as TerraGreen Coin and running  ICO to fund our platform. Also, we are going to come up with many  interesting products that will work on TerraGreen Blockchain.  \n\n\nBeing  a part of TerraGreen will benefit users in many ways and makes it  easier to trade in cryptocurrency. With this idea and mission, we are  going to announce many new products on our platform soon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/bjrkvy/terragreen_mission_opportunity/

bj4drx,1556636796,"Mentally feeling depressed, looking for how others view the future's outlook","Well after yesterday's askreddit thread on not talked about problems had a day of inflection and some digging into the world's issues left me depressed.\n\nFor some insight me: mid 30s, natural gearhead, work on construction machines for a living. Living in the suburbs of a major coastal city. Own 2 cars (turbo 4 cylinder project and another regular 4 cylinder hatchback for a daily to work) so yes I am the enemy. An electric car can't be afforded right now as saving for a house.\n\nUpon reading did resolve to get some plants in pots for the house I am renting in suburbia for the bugs, do my best to be mindful of not wasting what I buy and try to keep chemical use on the lawn down (hoa wants that fancy green lawn however). The mower and trimmer will be replaced with electric when they break beyond repair, will talk to the roommate when the energy contract is up to move to 100% renewable, tote bags to the grocery store, have to look into recycling and compost since our place doesn't have that option. So know its not much but it is something. Been mainly voting blue for most of my life.\n\nHowever I am conflicted as I have always had a love for machines since I was a teen. The turbo project is getting a cat when it is back up and running but when you see the large diesel engines run kinda makes other efforts seem futile. As my hobby is also not great for things and not easy to give up. \n\nI try to reason with myself about my job as we are keeping these running in top shape so they don't pollute more, but the more I think about it the more I am depressed. Can't say there is another field at the moment that pays the same (just jumped from automotive due to higher pay).\n\n I am glad I don't have kids because I don't know if I will see the end of my natural life, much less any offspring I would have.\n\nSo how do you put up with it? For any fellow gearheads what do you do to help offset your hobby?\n\nThanks for letting me vent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/bj4drx/mentally_feeling_depressed_looking_for_how_others/

b9n939,1554442002,ASEAN Biomass Waste Generation,"In ASEAN, energy from biomass represented about 12.41% of total renewable energy consumption in 2011. However, energy production from biomass still has a significant potential since a large portion of biomass is still underutilized. Moreover, increasing potential of energy crops and development of plant yield improvement technology will extend the bioenergy potential even more. Therefore, biomass is considered as a promising alternative energy source in future strategic energy planning both national and regional context.  \n\n\nASEAN is fast becoming an attractive market for developing biomass as an energy source. There is enormous potential of biomass energy in ASEAN countries given that it produces nearly 230 million tons of feedstock supply per year from diverse forms of wastes such as agricultural residues, agro-industrial wastes, woody biomass, animal wastes, municipal solid waste, etc. Southeast Asia is also a big producer of wood and agricultural products which, when processed in industries, it produces large amounts of biomass residues.\n\n According to conservative estimates, the amount of biomass residues generated from sugar, rice and palm oil mills is more than 230 million tons per year which corresponds to cogeneration potential of 16-19 GW. Woody biomass is a good energy resource due to presence of large number of forests and wood processing industries in the region.\n\n As a case example it is estimated that Indonesia only produces 146.7 million tons of biomass per year. This biomass is equivalent to about 470 GJ per year of energy production. However, biomass availability is distributed all over the country, but large concentrated scale can be found in the Island of Kalimantan, Sumatera, Irian Jaya and Sulawesi. The power generation estimated from the about 150 million tonne of biomass residues produced per year to be about 50 GW or equivalent to roughly 470 GJ per year. The main source of biomass energy in Indonesia is rice residues with a technical energy potential of 150 GJ per year. Other potential biomass sources are as follows:\n\n**a. Rubber wood residues (120 GJ per year),**\n\n**b. Sugar mill residues (78 GJ per year),**\n\n**c. Palm oil residues (67 GJ per year),**\n\n**d. 20 GJ per year in total from plywood and veneer residues, logging residues, sawn timber residues, coconut residues**\n\n Another source of biomass waste is municipal solid waste (MSW). Major percentage of these wastes originated from household in the form organic wastes from the kitchen. Currently, all the wastes are ether burned or dumped into a designated dumping ground or landfill, without any recovery for renewable energy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/b9n939/asean_biomass_waste_generation/

I know some use tissues, but that is still tree based, and I'm wondering what other alternatives might be out there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was wondering if anybody has used plant based products like a banana peel; instead of throwing away the banana peel maybe it could be repurposed. The real difficulty is not knowing the volume as sometimes you might only need to contain a small amount, yet for those massive loads green alternatives might be overwhelmed. I can't determine the best TP alternative.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/ayz2n7/toilet_paper_alt_for_masturbation/

aw928q,1551470618,Opinions on Subsistence Farming and Industrial Farming?,"For reference - Subsistence Farming consists of farming practices that are done only to feed a farmer and their family. Included in this would be growing crops, raising/breeding and slaughtering animals for their meat and hides, and other typical farming practices, but on a small-scale level where the farmer(s) are mostly self-sufficient and don't rely on selling the fruits of their labor to survive.\n\nIndustrial Farming, on the other hand, refers to the type of agriculture which involves the widespread use of pesticides on crops and the large-scale breeding and slaughtering of animals for profit that we see in many parts of the world today. I'm sure most people here are aware of the deleterious effects of this form of agriculture on the environment, so I won't go much further here.\n\nThe main reason I'm asking about this is to get some opinions on Subsistence Farming and if you think it's alright, but I'd also love to hear some views on how Industrial Farming could be rolled back without creating food shortages. Hope to hear back from some of you soon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/aw928q/opinions_on_subsistence_farming_and_industrial/

The setting is between 0 and 100%, with 0% meaning that the consumer is passing on none of the environmental cost of their purchases to others (that is, the consumer pays fees that fully address environmental damage), and 100% meaning that the consumer is passing on all of the environmental cost of their purchases to others (that is, the consumer pays no fees). All of the money from the fees goes towards addressing environmental damage. For example, the part of the fees that is for greenhouse gas emissions could go towards emissions-free energy infrastructure, reducing deforestation, etc. What do you think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/apus1z/looking_for_feedback_about_an_idea/

apkzl7,1549919022,Will Sustainability Kill or Enslave Us All? Part 1,"# What if...\n\nThere is no unmanageable world-wide resource shortage issue...  What if we just have policy and transparency issues. Here are two hot topics we want your feedback on:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Electric Cars:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*-Electric cars a) Grid Capacity* : Most cities don't have the grid capacity to take on the extra load - they are already having problems with peak power draw ([LEARN MORE](https://www.wired.com/story/electric-cars-impact-electric-grid/)). In our opinion, using the cars to complement the grid as batteries would result in efficiency losses &gt;20% and wearing down the expensive car batteries' life spans due to constant charging which may not be ideal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*-Electric cars b) Embodied Energy in a Car* the amount of resources it would take to replace every car with an electric one is immeasurable - honestly, we tried to do the math on it but without a way of re-using 100% of all existing cars it just doesn't add-up. ([LEARN MORE](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/sep/23/carbon-footprint-new-car):  *Making a new car creates as much carbon pollution as driving it*)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Electric cars proposition :*** We focus on a retrofit that works as a hybrid and runs on non-intensively farmed bio-fuel. Combined with policies for public transit, vehicle sharing bicycles and inter-city electric trains this may be the lowest-cost solution. What do you think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Focus on Carbon Neutrality and Carbon Tax:** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Carbon Neutrality a) Not Enough:*  While important - carbon neutrality is only a fraction of the widespread economic, social and environmental issues we are facing. We need to think more holistically in our sustainability marketing requirements. A product can destroy the environment, enslave the third world and wreak unspeakable havoc - all while being carbon neutral. We need to invest on a product-by-product purchase instead of blindly purchasing from companies who use archaic and wasteful practices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Carbon Neutrality b) More Tax?:* Let's take a step back from ""tax"" and examine a worker's 'earned value' against what they take home. Your earned value is the amount of money you earn your company per hour. Let's consider that this money is already invested in creating a sustainable government and company. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-70%: Most consultants, tradesmen, etc. only get paid about 30% of what their companies make per hour of them working to cover overhead costs. This is technically ""invested"" in maintaining a sustainable business for employees and is often mismanaged and unaccounted for.\n\n\-30%: Income tax on all money earned.\n\n\-13%(HST) - 5% (GST): Sales tax on most items purchased.\n\n\-30% Fuel Tax: Hidden in the existing cost driving + of everything since it took oil to make, extract or get to you.\n\n\-30%+ Alcohol and Tobacco Taxes: If you buy alcohol or tobacco you are taxed extra on that.\n\n\-30% Rent: Most young people are not earning any value for the equity they are helping to build or allowed to invest in the energy efficiency of their rental unit.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdd all that up and we're already investing nearly everything we have into this country and its corporations. Clearly it is time for some auditing to find out how we can make these systems run more efficiently with low-cost solutions. This doesn't have to mean solar panels on every roof - but simple policy changes can lead to huge staff time savings and resource use efficiency gains ([learn more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzzFNU2uIZQ): Lean Management Success Stories)!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe need a way to put more money into our bank accounts TOMORROW without big investments into the corporations we are already funding everyday. We have another blog coming up about how to do achieve this for low-cost regarding cars and homes - but for now let's switch gears and look at consumer products and food.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRead more and learn to make a HUGE environmental and economical  difference without the help of the government, subsidies or large  corporations!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf we consider the [graph below](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/05/31/this-giant-chart-shows-where-all-our-greenhouse-gases-come-from/), most of the world’s GHGs come from  poor stewardship and the products we use. Less than 30% world-wide comes  from the daily operations our cars and homes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zh2yyp3h00g21.png\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A bit over-simplified we know - however we think this is a conservative estimate - please give us your feedback!](https://i.redd.it/fc11j4pk00g21.png)\n\n### Let’s look at a holistic approach to cutting world-wide  environmental damage and not just those of our own countries’, cars and  homes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe could extrapolate and reasonably say that nearly all societal and  cultural damage comes from the products we use, and less-so our cars and  homes – but we’ll save that for another article!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Become an Eco-Builder or Eco-Buyer\n\nDo you buy things, build things or design things? Give the materials you are using another thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example – bamboo or wood can actually reduce the amount of carbon  in the atmosphere if harvested properly. Steel on the other hand is  very energy intensive to make. If you can switch from steel to wood, it  might have a more impactful and wide-sweeping environmental benefit than  anything else you could do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-Did this take more than 5 people or 3 steps to get to me?  \n \-Was this refined using lots of energy, oil or manpower?  \n \-Were there lots of intensive chemicals used to make this?  \n \-Can I use something else that’s less intensive, local, recycled or home-made?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## CONSIDER THIS ALSO...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChemical dyes, synthetic oils, plastics and other mystery items  wreak havoc on third world environments. They use immense energy to  store, transport and refine. There are alternatives to nearly every  energy-intensive products that we need to learn about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Intensive make-ups, chemicals, cleaners and lotions** –  anything heavily refined and processed can likely be replaced with  local hemp oils, vinegar cleaners, activated charcoal or other home-made  solutions.\n\nWe know that companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson were aware of  cancer causing agents in their products for decades and hid it. It is  time we not only stop supporting companies like this, but start knowing  exactly what is in our stuff. Check out these [homemade make-ups](https://lovelovething.com/18-homemade-makeup-recipes/) and let us know your thoughts!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Local fresh food, kombucha, kefir water can use way less energy than conventional alternatives.**  \- Fresh stuff takes almost no extra energy to get to you. Canned stuff  takes a bit more. Frozen stuff a lot more. Pre-made stuff with mystery  chemicals and preservatives took a lot more. One conventional can of  soda can use almost 1kWh to make and get to you – that’s +10% of your  daily energy use for home and travel [source – Sustainability Without the Hot Air](https://www.withouthotair.com/c15/page_89.shtml).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Replace some beverages with water** – if you are in love with filtered water consider making a [bio-sand filter at home](https://www.instructables.com/id/Biosand-Filter/) to filter your tap water and boom! Crisp water for free, for ever, at home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If you drink a lot of coffee** \- pick a time like  lunch and switch to locally grown tea for the second half of the day.  Try and make the switch – though we don’t blame you for needing a cup of  coffee, we love it too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Buy used clothes and items** – avoid the environmental  onslaught associated with the international textile and dye industries  by re-using clothes from thrift shops. Each re-used thing you buy could  be considered carbon-neutral compared to the alternative of making a  whole new one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Repair instead of Replace** – taking ownership for  understanding and fixing your stuff is not only environmental and  economical – but will give you a sense of pride and accomplishment that  is hard to duplicate in other facets of life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDid you know that half of our food is wasted? This means that we  could literally feed twice as many people with JUST SIMPLE POLICY,  SHARING AND HABIT CHANGES! Double-this-up with the embodied energy that  no one is talking about and we are talking about taking a HUGE dent out  of our resource efficiency problem…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Throw an** [**Eco-$aver Potluck**](https://steemit.com/foodsovereignty/@eco-locals.com/eco-usdaver-potlucks) \- lower food costs and increase options just copy and paste the directions from our post below to your friends and get goin’!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Convert your home to &gt;50% organic waste stream** – we need to stop throwing stuff in the garbage, period. Check out this awesome guide on how to do [stink-free composting in your apartment!](https://ohmyapt.apartmentratings.com/apartment-composting-without-the-smell.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong term, we expect more cities to conduct end-of-the-line compostable waste diversion ([check out the City of Edmonton’s program here](https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/garbage_waste/edmonton-composting-facility.aspx)). In the meantime, we must put pressure on industry by buying more 100% compostable products.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Push issues like composting and sustainable procurement at work** \- ask if you can bring your composting from home in to the office and use their diversion facilities. Think about local or re-used stuff for lunch-and-learns, gifts and other procurement needs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Organize your friends/office to order in bulk** \- from local suppliers together to save money and support eco-friendly businesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Participate in a food-sharing program if you own a restaurant - this way your left overs will be put to good use in the community!!!***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Getting rid of all car and home energy only reduces &lt;30% of  worldwide GHGs and leaves us with the environmental problems associated  with garbage, poisonous ingredients, weak local economies and soil  degradation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### We need to be thinking about changing our habits and wares to make a difference locally --\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The best part is** – when you get good at making local  sustainable stuff you can trade with your friends or even sell them!!!  This is the sustainable micro-economy we hope to help promote on  eco-locals.com by giving the community a database of items and ideas to  pull from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote that just because it’s local or ‘green’ or whatever – doesn’t  mean it’s good for the environment. You need holistic and verifiable  information to determine true environmental impacts. We think that supporting international economies is also critical to a sustainable earth - we just need to do it wisely and limit it to the things we can't get locally in most cases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Read our suggested Minimum Sustainability Listing Requirements](https://steemit.com/sustainability/@eco-locals.com/is-carbon-management-or-vague-labeling-ever-going-to-be-enough)  \n [Read our Free Holistic Rating System](https://steemit.com/sustainability/@eco-locals.com/holistic-sustainability-reporting-for-consumer-products-and-meals)  \n [Read about How We Try To Obliterate “Green Brain-Washing”](https://steemit.com/sustainability/@eco-locals.com/why-do-we-need-sustainability-rating-systems-and-marketplaces)\n\n[Read about Eco-$aver Potlucks to save money, time and the environment with your friends!](https://steemit.com/foodsovereignty/@eco-locals.com/eco-usdaver-potlucks)  \n [Read about Steemit + Reddit’s Critical Role in Sustainability on Earth](https://steemit.com/sustainability/@eco-locals.com/defining-the-matrix-steemit-fb-critical-pieces-to-sustainability-on-earth)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCOMING SOON:  \n Best car + home energy savers  \n Favorite DIY home-made solutions to consumer products\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPLEASE LEAVE A COMMENT AND TELL US:  \n \-Do you make an environmentally friendly product at home to replace a conventionally harmful one?  \n \-What did we miss?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/apkzl7/will_sustainability_kill_or_enslave_us_all_part_1/

a9p0rl,1545834962,Delhi Can't Breathe: Why Do Indian City's Have the Most Polluted Air on the World?," Every winter, the air of Delhi becomes an unbreathable morass. By some estimates, breathing one day of Delhi air when air quality is at it's worst is equivalent to smoking 44 cigarettes and the toxic air reduces life expectancy by approximately six years. The burden of air pollution falls especially hard on the elderly and infirm, and an entire generation is growing up breathing suffocating levels of pollution. According to the World Health Organization, Delhi is the most highly polluted megacity in the world, and three of the ten most polluted cities in the world are in the neighborhood of Delhi. In today's podcast episode, I discuss the agricultural origins of air pollution in Delhi, I discuss the non-agricultural sources of pollution, and the environmental Kuznets curve.\n\nIn a previous podcast episode, I discussed the [environmental ramifications](https://wealthofnationspodcast.com/the-rice-of-wrath-how-obscure-british-land-law-and-free-electricity-created-economic-stagnation-and-environmental-disaster-in-punjab/) of the green revolution.  One that I did not discuss was the air pollution created by the burning of rice stubble after the harvest. Modern mechanized harvesters leave a large amount of rice straw that needs to cleared before the planting of the winter wheat crop. The cheapest and fastest method to clear the fields is to burn to rice straw,  and more than 2 million farmers burn 23 million tons of rice residue over 80,000 sq km of farmland resulting in massive fires. As much as a third of the air pollution comes from these fires. Although the government has banned burning rice residue, the state governments have struggled to do so. For one thing, government policies such as [enforced sowing](https://www.pressreader.com/india/the-times-of-india-new-delhi-edition/20181020/281663960984871) times and large subsidies of mechanized harvesters only encourages more burning. The government has provided subsidies of 80% for the purchase of mulchers that process rice, but it is a slower process that costs 3 times more than burning the fields after subsidies are taken into account.\n\nMany of the sources of air pollution come much closer to the city of Delhi. India is a major importer of Petroleum Coke, a by-product of refining heavy oils such as those produced in Canadian tar sands and emits twice as much sulfur as coal making it one of the most polluting sources of energy. The Indian government has announced a partial ban on the import of [petcoke](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/why-is-pet-coke-still-being-used-in-city-asks-hc/articleshow/67169254.cms) for 2018, although certain industries are exempt. Similarly, the rapid growth of diesel car use has had a strongly negative impact on air quality. The number of cars in Delhi has more than tripled over the last 8 years.  Moreover, between 2004 and 2014 the percent of cars sold in India that used diesel went up from one quarter of all cars to one half.  In 2014, the government of India phased diesel subsidies out, and demand for diesel cars has collapsed. Only 23% of all cars sold in 2018 are expected to be diesel. Finally, coal, the only natural resource India has ample reserves of, is a major contributor to air pollution. There are over a dozen thermal coal power plants surrounding Delhi and the largest Badarpur, had long been falsifying records on emissions to pass standards. The Badarpur powerplant, and many others are being [phased out](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/badarpur-thermal-plant-shut-for-good/articleshow/66228551.cms) to help reduce levels of air pollution.\n\nOne of the most important ideas for understanding air pollution in Delhi is the environmental Kuznets curve. The idea of the Kuznets curve is that levels of air pollution are lowest in low and high income countries, but much higher in middle income countries. India's rapid economic growth means it is rapidly approaching middle economic status has resulted in a massive increase in pollution. Many cities in the developed word such as Pittsburgh and Manchester were once famous for being the types of places where a person could go to work in a white shirt and come back in a gray one. It is a process we have seen in Beijing, which for a long time was considered the most polluted city in the world. However [since 2013](https://www.who.int/airpollution/data/cities/en/), Beijing and the Chinese national government has placed draconian measures to curb pollution. Coal use was cut by one half since 2013, and major construction and steel projects mothballed. Levels of air pollution are down by 20% since 2013. The experience of Beijing shows that the Kuznets curve isn't a natural inevitability, but the result of sustained changes in policy.\n\nSources:\n\n[Economic growth and **environmental** degradation: the **environmental Kuznets curve** and sustainable development ;   ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305750X96000320)David Stern, Michael Common, Edward Barbier\n\n[Off Target: Status of Thermal Power Plants in Delhi NCR ; Centre for Science and Environment](http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/files/file/Off-Target---Status-of-Power-Stations-Report.pdf)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/a9p0rl/delhi_cant_breathe_why_do_indian_citys_have_the/

a6k0m1,1544916400,"Is One Country's Trash, Another Country's Treasure: What Happened When China Banned the Import of Waste Plastic?"," Since 1950, the word has produced 8.3 billion tons of plastic, and 322 million in 2015 alone. Plastic utensils and other waste is filling up our landfills and choking our oceans. Plastic can only be properly recycled after being sorted and graded, a labor intensive process that most wealthy consumers are unwilling to do. As a result, tens of millions of tons of plastic waste are exported to China where this plastic is recycled and re-purposed. The plastic recycling may have solved environmental problems in wealthy nations, but created new ones in China. The plastic imported  that could not be recycled was often dumped into China's streets and rivers, and between 10-15% of China's plastic waste originated in the developed world. Moreover, the acrid fumes and toxic by-products of plastic recycling damage the environment. Wen'an, the city at the center of China's plastic recycling industry, is one of the most polluted in China. To solve these problems, China effectively banned the import of plastic waste in 2017, creating a host of problems for the rest of the world.\n\nIt is estimated that 111 million tons of plastic worth $ 7 billion  need to be redirected to make up for the loss of Chinese markets, and over three quarters of world's plastic waste exports once went to China . Some of this plastic was redirected to other markets, although it is unlikely any set of countries can replace the central role placed by China. Imports of plastic waste to Indonesia have increased by 56%, doubled to Vietnam, and increased 10 fold in Thailand. Malaysia has emerged as the largest importer of plastic, importing an estimated 160 million tons of plastic waste, more than any other country in the world. However, the same environmental problems of recycling plastic has overwhelmed these countries. Malaysia and Thailand will ban the import of plastic by 2021, and it is likely over time other countries will follow suit. Much of the plastic once sent to China is accumulating in warehouses and recycling centers in wealthy nations, and no one knows what to do with it.  \n\nThe Chinese government banned the import of waste paper in addition to waste plastic. The economics of paper recycling are similar to that of plastic. China once imported $5 billion worth of waste paper, roughly half of the world's total.  However, unlike with plastic, India is increasingly replacing China in waste paper imports. Indian imports of waste paper have doubled since 2007, and thanks to China's ban, are expected to more than double in 2018. Much of the labor intensive process of sorting and grading waste paper happens in the slums of Indian cities where wages are low, and environmental standards lower. The most famous slum based recycling center is that of Dharavi, made famous by the movie Slumdog Millionaire, but it is hardly the only such recycling hub in India. After grading and sorting, the paper is sent to paper mills where it is converted into newspapers and packaging. It is expected that by 2025, two thirds of all the paper mill feed-stock will come from recycled sources, much of this imported from abroad. \n\n**Selected Sources**  \n[The Chinese import ban and its impact on global plastic waste trade](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/6/eaat0131.full%EF%BB%BF)  \n\n\n[www.wealthofnationspodcast.com](https://www.wealthofnationspodcast.com/)\n\n[http://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/India\_-\_Dharavi.mp3](http://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/India_-_Dharavi.mp3)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/a6k0m1/is_one_countrys_trash_another_countrys_treasure/

9zs6ef,1543007868,Going Green: I think I have it figured out.,"Going Green isn't cheap. Take the simple thought of getting away from the use of fossil fuels Just around your personal life where possible. You have to replace your vehicle; Fix/Change/Repair your home so that you need less energy; Install Solar/Wind/Other alternative energy sources and storage options. These things are far from cheap and I am far from rich. \n\nSo, I have a plan to win. I have decided to join the enemy.\n\nYou won't win a war with an industry that produces oil or coal by staging protests or sabotaging production. So long as their is demand, they will produce. You win be reducing demand. If they have no one that want's to buy their product, they will have no incentive to continue producing it.\n\nCome Monday, I will now be an employee of the oil industry. My goal is to go green in my life with the money I earn from them.  I will take money from them and use it to do my part in reducing the need for their product.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a road map that starts with paying off the house and land I am on.\n\n1. Pay of the mobile home / land (inherited) - future savings towards further projects\n2. start looking for / possible purchase used Tesla Model X  - future fuel savings towards further projects.  buy solar credits from electric company to ensure my usage comes not from the filthy coal burner nearby.\n3. Begin construction of downsized, but highly efficient home. (compressed earth blocks, airlock entry)\n4. get rid of this crap house my mother got suckered into buying. 15 years she pays on it and it's worth less than owed.\n5. Buy ultra high efficient air conditioning systems. air source heat pumps are now available at SEER 31 or bettter, ground source heat pumps are up to 45 EER ( and they provide your hot water as a side effect)\n6. Install elevated solar panel system that shades agriculture below.\n\nI have the time and I'm single. This is what I have always wanted to do.

However ethno nationalism by it's nature believes in ""blood and soil"". This means everyone in a society has personal roots in their land. Most people aren't willing to pollute in their own backyard or garden. Ethno-nationalism extends the concept of the backyard to all of society. Japan is a politically tolerated albeit ethno-nationalist country. There's a strict environmental culture and this is rooted in having personal ties to the land. However Japan has no issue with demolishing a rainforest in Brazil. I myself am not an ethno-nationalist. Though perhaps I am a fascist (there is a difference). Even though I'm against racism, I concede that ethno-nationalism has this byproduct. I'm curious if anyone else sees this pattern.

By the end we had huge piles of plastic, cigarette butts, bottle caps, glass, syringes, and plenty of other weird stuff. It was a great afternoon, but at the same time quite shocking to see the result.\n\nHere is the event report: [https://plana.earth/academy/clean-up-bocklerpark/](https://plana.earth/academy/clean-up-bocklerpark/)\n\nEvents like this are part of Plan A's mission to break down the barriers that can exist between people and climate/ environmental action. We aim to promote discussion and motivation to push for a sustainable future.\n\nWe have some exciting stuff in the works, so feel free to follow us on here and other social media to stay up to speed.

9bzcqt,1535766080,Are independent environmental audit groups going to end up like corrupt banking auditors?,"I just read that the carbon offset group 3Degrees is audited by an independent group called Green-e. From what I understand about independent audit groups from the banking crisis is that audit firms are funded by their clients, who are only willing to pay for positive reviews. Firms that flunk the clients that don't meet their standards inevitably get less clients and are consequently go out of business. The eventual effect this has on the clients is rampant incompetency or reckless irresponsibility. The following article describes what I am talking about in more detail:\n\nhttps://whistlinginthewind.org/2013/08/31/the-failure-of-private-auditing/\n\nWhat's to stop this from happening to the green movement? Will standards and requirements gradually weaken until certification is nothing more than a facade? It seems dangerous to have such a major offset management company independently audited. Are the results of these investigations or audits made publicly available? Under the system of supply and demand it's supposed to be up to the end consumer to stop funding suspicious groups that don't stand up to scrutiny, but that doesn't work if we are having the blinds pulled over our eyes, so to speak.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/9bzcqt/are_independent_environmental_audit_groups_going/

9bhoo9,1535615940,How can growing economies develop quickly without destroying the environment?,"China's economic rise has been mind-blowing, but it's come at an environmental cost that may end up hurting the country in the long run. Nearly 30% of fossil fuel emissions come from China, according to data here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_carbon\_dioxide\_emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions). I know China is doing a lot with solar energy but it still seems like they're a long way from cleaning up their environment, and much damage can't be reversed.   \n\n\nAs other large countries undergo explosive economic growth, like India, Bangladesh, and Ethiopia, they're experiencing similar issues. How can they limit damage to the environment and ensure long-term sustainability and environmental health (which is crucial to the health of the people)? \n\nObviously, things like electric-powered vehicles coming from Chevy, Tesla, and others are a start. We must also learn to make smarter use of waste. 3D printing can help repurpose all that plastic sitting in landfills. The plastic bank idea is really cool too ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/annefield/2017/11/29/the-plastic-bank-using-plastic-to-create-a-global-currency-for-the-poor/#3b033d5f7433](https://www.forbes.com/sites/annefield/2017/11/29/the-plastic-bank-using-plastic-to-create-a-global-currency-for-the-poor/#3b033d5f7433)).   \n\n\nThere are startups working to make construction materials more eco-friendly, such as XMaterials in Bulgaria ([xmat.io](https://xmat.io)) and Artic Sand Technologies, a semiconductor company transforming power management in electronic devices ([https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/arctic-sand-technologies](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/arctic-sand-technologies)). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, as economies in Asia, Africa, and South America continue to expand, how can we ensure quality of life, from an environmental point of view, isn't destroyed? Obviously, there are lots of solutions but more needs to be done to make sure we grow sustainably.   \n\n\nThis requires not just great ideas from bright minds and the ability to execute those ideas, but also a coordinated effort from governments and organizations, as well as motivated people. The former is happening, but the latter is lagging behind. We need more action now -- or else we're doomed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/9bhoo9/how_can_growing_economies_develop_quickly_without/

93edyy,1533043011,Android app - AC bill saver : Massive reduction in electricity usage &amp; bills by running your AC at maximum efficiency,"Hi this eco friendly app is my humble contribution to preserve our environment.\n\nApp will provide massive savings in your electricity bills. AC efficiency is maximized to the fullest by running AC at its lowest possible temp(eg:- 16℃) when compressor is ON &amp; then AC is run in FAN mode(compressor OFF) and AC mode(compressor OFF) cycles repeatedly.\n\n\*\* ***App will only work on phones with IR Blaster(infra-red) hardware. \*\****\n\nPlaystore link : [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobitronix.gauravchauhan.acbillsaver.premium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobitronix.gauravchauhan.acbillsaver.premium)\n\nApp screenshots :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/r5qmDZR](https://imgur.com/a/r5qmDZR)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/ueQp1ZI](https://imgur.com/a/ueQp1ZI)\n\nIn contrast in a traditional AC operation, lets say you set temp. as 24℃.\n\nThen the AC will not run at its max. efficiency during its compressor ON cycle,since it will be blasting relatively warmer blast of air(as compared to completely chilled air at 16℃) to give you 24℃ like feel .\n\nUsing this app you can set AC &amp; FAN mode cycle durations manually eg:- 15/5 minutes respectively. So a AC mode cycle of completely chilled air at 16℃, will be followed by a bill saving FAN mode cycle of 15 minutes. Overall for the full ON/OFF cycle, you will have the same comfort level as setting 24℃ in a traditional AC. But with an advantage of peak AC efficiency &amp; massive electricity bill saving.\n\nTo understand how this methodology is more efficient, first take a look at an AC operates traditionally.\n\n**Traditional AC operation :** Using a traditional AC remote, you set up a temp. which is convenient as per weather. Let's say 24℃.\n\nNow using sensors AC will try to maintain room temp. at 24℃ by frequently switching ON/OFF compressor.\n\nBut to give you 24℃ like feel it won't blow completely chilled air that it is capable of, when compressor is ON. Instead relatively warmer blast of air is given.This in turn will mean room temp. will rise above 24℃ much quicker(compared to scenario had AC been set at 16℃ during compressor ON cycle). Which means compressor will have to be switched ON more frequently &amp; for longer duration, as compared to 16℃ setting.\n\n**Operate AC at max. efficiency using this app.** Instead here you will set AC at its lowest temp eg:- 16℃. And then you can specify durations for which AC should be in FAN mode &amp; AC mode respectively.\n\nWhile compressor is ON, AC will blow fully chilled air at 16℃, instead of relatively warmer air for 24℃ like feel as in traditional AC operation.\n\nLet's say you choose FAN mode &amp; AC mode durations as 15/5 minutes respectively. When in AC mode, compressor will blow fully chilled air for 5 minutes. And room will get sufficiently cool for next FAN mode(compressor OFF) cycle of 15 minutes. These FAN/AC mode cycles will repeat over &amp; over again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/93edyy/android_app_ac_bill_saver_massive_reduction_in/

8usnpx,1530274507,Clean2Antarctica: A quest for change,"Hey people! I'll be going on a 'quest for change': https://www.clean2antarctica.nl/en/explore/challenging-companies-and-millenials\n\nThat is, a sailing trip with a tallship ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgenster_(ship) ) from the Netherlands to the Canary Islands, from the 24th of August to the 20th of September. The ship will sail on to Antarctica, where it will drop off a couple that made a vehicle completely out of plastic and other reusable / sustainable things (e.g. solar panels for energy); the Solar Voyager ( https://www.clean2antarctica.nl/en/explore/building-solar-voyager ). This couple will drive the Solar Voyager to the geographical South Pole, where it will conduct some research.\n \nWhy? Because one day this entirely ordinary couple - could be you! - turned over their trash bin, saw a lot of 'useless' plastic, and wanted to change this. So they took their plastic, and despite everyone saying how impossible it is, they now have this whole journey planned out. The sailing voyage consists of six parts (e.g. from the Netherlands to the Canary Islands) and on each part 20 students from all over the world (amongst which myself) will work on sustainability projects for certain companies.\n \nBut it's not only about multi-national corporate chemical industries or such - it's also about you. They hope to inspire people to look at their own actions; you can shower a minute shorter, or a degree colder, or eat less meat, or not throw plastic away into nature... In order to fully utilise their reach, to truly inspire each and everyone to work towards a sustainable world, they need more than just the two of them and all the amazing things they have achieved so far. I mean, imagine yourself entering a company like Royal Dutch Shell - what could you possibly achieve there? But they have done things like that, with success! And I, and other students, are doing so too, with success. They are engaging with parties ranging from huge multi-nationals to little children in Africa, and I truly think they and their can-do mentality is one of the best ways to get these huge companies to change and to inspire the whole planet. I mean, you can see the results already - they are in National Geography, they are weekly on (Dutch) television, they have these huge companies that have committed themselves to change, it's quite amazing.\n\nWorking towards a sustainable future does not mean 'decreasing living standards' or 'having a less convenient life' or anything like that. It is not a negative (I probably don't need to tell you people that, on this subreddit). What if seven billion people made one tiny tiny change? That adds up! So finally, above all, take a look at your own lifestyle - what tiny tiny change can you make to improve the world?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/8usnpx/clean2antarctica_a_quest_for_change/

8mshzt,1527534256,Global Warming is NOT a Myth from China,"	Earth is the sole planet we can live on. It has the oxygen we need to fill our lungs. It has the water we need to quench our thirst. It has the plants and animals we need to satisfy our hunger. Now imagine Earth without all these resources. What would we do? We would have nowhere to go. We would die.\n	While the extinction of humanity would be very healthy for the Earth, it’s a pessimistic approach to the problems our environment is facing. Instead, we should look for ways to save our Earth through other means, such as reducing our carbon footprint, saving energy, and investing in sources of renewable energy.\n	Global warming can have harmful effects on the Earth and its inhabitants. The global temperature is the average annual temperature across the entirety of Earth. If this temperature is raised by even just two degrees celsius from today, there could be catastrophic consequences. Mountain glaciers and rivers will disappear, and could eliminate freshwater from a third of the planet. Landslides will be more frequent as the permafrost that holds the mountains together begin to melt away. The sea level will have risen about a metre, submerging a massive amount of land and displacing a whopping 10% of the world’s population. The heat will also begin to kill thousands of people, and threatens extinction for a third of the Earth’s animals. Plant growth will slowly begin to stop, and eventually they won’t absorb carbon dioxide very well, instead starting to emmit it, worsening global warming. Additionally, icebergs and glaciers will become smaller, which means less of the sun’s heat is reflected off ice and back into space.\n	Even worse, this is not a problem that is far off in the future. As of now, scientists believe that even if we completely stop carbon dioxide emissions this instant, we are still guaranteed to at least reach a global temperature increase of 1.5! If we want to keep Earth habitable in the future, this is something we need to stop now!\n	One of the ways we can help stop this global catastrophe is using renewable sources of energy like solar and wind. These sources of energy don’t have as much of a harm on the environment. In addition, using them can improve our health. Most carbon emissions come from coal and natural gas, which are non-renewable sources of energy. On the other hand, renewable sources of energy produce little to no global warming emissions. Even after including the emissions coming from manufacturing, installation, and operation, they are minimal. Burning coal to produce electricity can create 1.4 to 3.6 pounds of carbon-dioxide per kilowatt-hour, while solar energy only produces 0.07 to 0.2 pounds on a life cycle basis. Wind energy produces even less, with 0.02 to 0.04 pounds of carbon-dioxide.\n	Now that you know the benefits of green energy and the horrible consequences of non-renewable energy, doesn’t it make sense to switch? We need to fight global warming, and green energy is our weapon. It’s time to make the change.\n\nUpvote for Part 2.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/8mshzt/global_warming_is_not_a_myth_from_china/

The person they hire is a tree service, who wants money. So of course the tree service says, ""Yeah! It'll fall! Let's cut it, just to be safe!"" \n\nThe final straw that made me search this place out was driving by a neighbor and seeing him look at a tree. Unless he was just observing the wonder of it, I think he was getting that little voice saying, ""ooh, that might fall. Let's cut it."" or, ""part of that tree is on MY property. HIS tree can't be on MY property. I'll cut it now.""\n\nThis kind of stuff really triggers me because I'm very attuned to these kind of things. Anyway, does anyone have any tips on handling this, or can point me in the right direction? I mean if I could save a tree, that would be great. I also want to find like minded people.

The user then responds wether they have/haven't done these things. They are then represented as an avatar on map and any green acts they've done, are also represented. You can then see how many people around you are taking responsibility to be sustainable and find out other ways in which you can. It's cool when everyone is doing it ! \n\nThe main aims of the app are to connect people in being sustainable in order to create green movements where the user can see, 'oh, this is what everyone is doing now, Ill do it'.

8djiew,1524183791,"I do not own a vehicle and have been contemplating getting one some time soon, but want to know just how bad is it for the environment?","I was considering getting a motorized vehicle such as a car soon and am having second thoughts due to the potentially negative impact of owning and operating one. Am I misinformed about this or is it really not that bad? Can someone please direct me to some unbiased literature so I can make an informed decision?\n\nA lot of my perception of how bad cars are for the environment is from 20+ years ago so I don't exactly assume it's accurate.\n\nYeah, it is much more difficult and honestly more expensive for me to function as a full-time working adult in the society of the USA without a vehicle, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to advance in any way without one, so I'm torn. I want to impact the environment as little as possible but honestly feel as though owning a vehicle would ultimately help me to accomplish that more than not owning one- as in I haven't done the math yet but I highly speculate that owning a vehicle, as bad as I assume it is for the environment, would be outweighed by what it allows me to do otherwise for the environment. Is this non-sense and the impact of owning one is just so bad that you can't outweigh it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/8djiew/i_do_not_own_a_vehicle_and_have_been/

83r87l,1520817059,"Help save the world, for free, in only one minute!","I hope I am not wrong for posting this here. Please let me know before you kick me from the subreddit. I just wanted to share a great opportunity for anyone that purchases ANYTHING online to help save the environment and offset global warming. If I break the rules it is because this is a FREE and PASSIVE way to save the earth in under one (1) minute of effort. \n\nTL;DR Signing up, in only one minute,  connects users to a platform that uses 66% of  commissions from 3500+ business partners to support Reforestation and Protection Projects, Methane Capture at Landfills, and Renewable Energy Technology installations. AT NO COST TO USERS! Link is at the bottom of the page.\n\nFull disclosure I am a Student Sustainability Coordinator at my University. I am also serving as a Brand Ambassador for Ucapture on my Campus. It is important to say that the carbon offsets generated by user activity are recorded under the name of the school that referred the user to our platform. This is why I posted a personalized link. With your help, my university can offset a meaningful portion of our carbon footprint without blowing the sustainability budget. Our goal is to offset 30% of our 100,000 metric ton annual carbon footprint.\n\nUcapture is a FREE google browser extension that activates automatically on any given partner’s website. If you sign up now an email will be sent when extensions are back up and running on Firefox and Safari. There is also an iPhone app, but the extension is the best because it is passive. \n\n If the businesses are a partner then they pay a commission on your purchase, at no cost to you! Ucapture uses two-thirds of commissions earned to fund carbon offset projects. Currently Ucapture averages eight pounds of carbon offset per dollar spent with our partners. Take Expedia an average person’s foot print from a flight is about 1000lbs of CO2. If bought as a Ucapture partner, avg ticket price $110, Ucapture can offset 800-1200lbs annually for the length of the project (8-15yrs). So one plane ticket could offset 10,000lbs over the projects life!  Most of the time it offsets the entire flight, but even if you don’t fly that is still less than $10 of online spending a MONTH\nSome partners don’t even have a large carbon footprint, so the offset is higher. These projects are certified for the carbon offset by agencies like the Climate Action Reserve (CAR).\n\nUcapture has over 3,500 business partners such as Best Buy, Budget, Dish, Fandango, Groupon, and Walmart. With the amount and variety of partners it has never been easier to support projects such as reforestation, renewable energy technology, and methane capture at landfills (26X denser that CO2). It only takes one minute to take advantage of this platform and help slow global warming. The attached link will take you to the sign-up page. After signing up, install the browser extension in the upper right corner and you’re done! It really does only take one minute! \n\nThe browser extension will also automatically pull up any applicable coupons for your purchase. Ucapture offers a way to push the cost of environmentalism back onto the corporations and businesses. I think Ucapture has alot of potential and the more poeple that use it the more change we can create. Please take one minute to save your wallet and save the Earth.\n\nSign-Up: www.ucapture.com/krisk\n\nOver 380 tons offset in 700+ acre Arcata Forest Reserve\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kFWarbIfkzI\n\nOver 1,000 Tons Offset at Wolf Creek Landfill\n\nhttps://www.ucapture.com/projects-items/wolf-creek-landfill/ ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/83r87l/help_save_the_world_for_free_in_only_one_minute/

80tr8t,1519797584,Another look at global Warming,"Global Warming, Another Look\n\nIn the ongoing debate over global warming media attention has focused\non a growing chorus of alarming predictions coming from the scientific and\nenvironmental communities and denials by the economic and political\nsectors founded on lack of firm proof. Proponents point to growing\nevidence of increasing temperature and point out that waiting for\nunequivocal proof will leave it too late to avoid catastrophe. Opponents\nclaim that the economic costs of greenhouse gas reduction would be too\nhigh to bear without clear evidence of necessity.While the media\nchooses to concentrate on controversy and threats of calamity there is a\nsignificant and credible minority opinion in science that presents a quite\ndifferent perspective. In this view the purported warming has been\nexaggerated.  The extent to which it does exist is largely due to natural\ncauses, and it is more likely to be beneficial than detrimental. Many\ngeologists in particular adhere to this persuasion but it receives little notice\nfrom the media.Geologists now have powerful tools for looking at past\nclimate records preserved in sediments and ice cores. They have clear\nevidence that the recent epoch of glacial cycles involves over a hundred\nglacial periods spanning the past several million years. Looking at such\nrecords we are now nearing the end of a warm interglacial period when\ntemperature peaks, just before the plunge into a new glacial cycle.\nThese cycles correspond to cycles in the Earth’s orbit that affect how\nmuch sunlight the planet receives. Superimposed on this pattern are\nshorter term cycles of solar activity that also effect climate on a shorter\ntime scale. These latter cycles correspond to sunspot activity and they are\nrecorded in the formation of the isotope Beryllium 10 which can be read in\nice and sediment cores. Comparing temperature and sunspot activity over\nthe past 1000 years we find that the record high temperatures of the past\ndecade corresponds to a record high level of solar activity. The general\nconsensus among those knowledgeable in this area is that certainly most of\nthe recently observed temperature increase is attributable to natural cycles\nand any contribution from increased greenhouse gases must be minor.  It\nalso means that contrary to the global warming scenario we are probably\nclose to entering another ice age. Whether &amp;quot;close&amp;quot; in this sense means\ndecades or centuries is uncertain but one piece of evidence indicates it may\nbegin sooner rather than later. Ice age sediments from the Arctic\nOcean contain abundant remains of open water plankton. Contrary to what\none might expect, the Artic Ocean is mostly open water during glacial\nperiods. This is not as unreasonable as it may seem. The ice covered Artic is\nnow a polar desert in terms of atmospheric moisture. An open water Arctic\n\nOcean would greatly increase moisture and snowfall leading to greatly\nincreased ice buildup on land and accelerated cooling by reflection of solar\nradiation from ice, snow, and clouds. This could only maintain of course, if\nthe sea remained open and this could only happen with an inflow of\nwarmer water. This in turn would most likely involve a diversion of a\nportion of the Gulf Stream into the Artic Ocean. Thinning of Arctic Ocean\nice and increasing ice free areas in summer has been noticeable in recent\ndecades.  If continued for another decade or two this will result in much of\nthe sea being open in summer. It seems reasonable that some point in this\nprocess may be the threshold for a shift in current patterns and the turning\npoint into the next glacial cycle.In the meantime another study just\nreleased has found evidence of past bleaching events in coral cores over the\nlast 1000 years so the recently observed bleaching events are not\nunprecedented but may also just be something that occasionally happens\nin our dynamic world.How all of this may play out in the real world\nwill probably be argued until actuality settles it. We have neither the will to\nchange ourselves nor the means to change the world and only a very\nlimited ability to predict it. We can however enjoy the ride. It should be a\nmost interesting one\n\nGlobal warming has become perhaps the most complicated issue facing\nworld leaders. On the one hand, warnings from the scientific community\nare becoming louder, as an increasing body of science points to rising\ndangers from the ongoing buildup of human-related greenhouse gases —\nproduced mainly by the burning of fossil fuels and forests. On the other,\nthe technological, economic and political issues that have to be resolved\nbefore a concerted worldwide effort to reduce emissions can begin have\ngotten no simpler, particularly in the face of a global economic slowdown.\nGlobal talks on climate change opened in Cancún, Mexico, in late 2010\nwith the toughest issues unresolved, and the conference produced modest\nagreements. But while the measures adopted in Cancún are likely to have\nscant near-term impact on the warming of the planet, the international\nprocess for dealing with the issue got a significant vote of confidence.\nThe agreement fell well short of the broad changes scientists say are\nneeded to avoid dangerous climate change in coming decades. But it laid\nthe groundwork for stronger measures in the future, if nations are able to\novercome the emotional arguments that have crippled climate change\nnegotiations in recent years. The package, known as the Cancún\nAgreements, gives the more than 190 countries participating in the\nconference another year to decide whether to extend the frayed Kyoto\nProtocol, the 1997 agreement that requires most wealthy nations to trim\ntheir emissions while providing assistance to developing countries to\npursue a cleaner energy future.\nAt the heart of the international debate is a momentous tussle between rich\nand poor countries over who steps up first and who pays most for changed\nenergy menus.\nIn the United States, on Jan. 2, 2011, the Environmental Protection Agency\nimposed its first regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions. The\nimmediate effect on utilities, refiners and major manufacturers will be\nsmall, with the new rules applying only to those planning to build large\nnew facilities or make major modifications to existing plants.  Over the\nnext decade, however, the agency plans to regulate virtually all sources of\ngreenhouse gases, imposing efficiency and emissions requirements on\nnearly every industry and every region.\nPresident Obama vowed as a candidate that he would put the United States\non a path to addressing climate change by reducing emissions of carbon\n\ndioxide and other greenhouse gas pollutants. He offered Congress wide\nlatitude to pass climate change legislation, but held in reserve the threat of\nE.P.A. regulation if it failed to act. The deeply polarized Senate’s refusal to\nenact climate change legislation essentially called his bluff.\nBut working through the E.P.A. has guaranteed a clash between the\nadministration and Republicans that carries substantial risks for both\nsides. The administration is on notice that if it moves too far and too fast in\ntrying to curtail the ubiquitous gases that are heating the planet it risks a\nCongressional backlash that could set back the effort for years.  But the\nnewly muscular Republicans in Congress could also stumble by moving too\naggressively to handcuff the Environmental Protection Agency, provoking a\npopular outcry that they are endangering public health in the service of\ntheir well-heeled patrons in industry.\n\nI call this particular discourse “The Disagreement Over the Cause of\nGlobal Warming” due to the split in the scientific community on this issue. The rhetorical situation that I chose includes two authors; one who believes that global warming is part of the natural climate cycle of the Earth and the other who believes that it is a man-made phenomenon. Every rhetorical situation consists of four components: rhetor, audience, exigence, and constraints. Each constituent plays a unique and crucial role in every rhetorical situation. It is\ndifficult to choose a single element as the most important to the situation. As my answer to this conundrum I have chosen the exigence as the most essential component to any rhetorical situation. Global warming is a topic that is on everyone’s mind today. There have been countless movies, television shows and debates concerning the root cause of the climate change that has\noccurred within the past 100 years. The one part of the debate over climate change that both viewpoints agree on is that climate actually is changing. If this exigence was not there, the rhetorical situation would not exist.\nThe other commonly held viewpoint on climate change is that the warming is caused by an increase in the levels of “greenhouse gasses” due to humans burning fossil fuels. One side believes that climate change can be reversed or reduced if humans stop burning fossil fuels. The exigence in this rhetorical situation lays the foundation for the debate. The exigence is the basis of any rhetorical situation. An issue such as global warming arises and there is matter and motivation that draws the rhetor and audience into the situation.\nThe exigence in a rhetorical situation is like the roots of a tree; it is the roots that sprout the finished product.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/80tr8t/another_look_at_global_warming/

Looking to the findings of the International Panel on Climate Change and the commitments of the Paris Agreement, when a group says they care about fighting climate change, they have to prove it by measuring their emissions and lowering them to a certain amount.\n\nSo I decided to take a similar tactic and apply it to the lives of everyday Americans. I made a visual article that teaches people how they can actually fight climate change by taking big, long-term actions in their lives. The carbon reductions of these actions are measurable and are in line with the U.S. Paris Agreement goal.\n\nYou can find it here: https://www.slideshare.net/MichaelLipowicz/how-to-actually-fight-climate-change-in-the-us-86601599\n\nI would be happy to discuss and answer any questions. Thank You!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/7ufgvt/how_to_actually_fight_climate_change_in_the_us_a/

For my senior thesis project I am going to create a mobile app prototype that teaches people about their disposal habits (avg. stats and long-term impact) and encourages them to reduce their landfill waste.

7u40wm,1517344064,Buses instead of cars?,"I remember reading an article about the environmental impacts of every person on our great planet giving up their cars and just using public transport. Well I've had a few thoughts and just wondered if they sounded plausible. Also I'm from the UK so things may sound different depending where you're from.\n\nFirstly, there would obviously be an increased need for bus routes for rural commutes and likely more trains. For example I live in a very small village that has a bus, usually for the elderly, once a week so I need a car for work and social reasons. But I personally don't like driving which brings me to my second point:\n\nIncreased tax and costs to own a car. This is to hopefully persuade people to use the increased public transport and the money from rich people and die-hard motor-heads (through vehicle tax, road tax and insurance and fuel reserved exclusively for vehicles) would possibly fund this, as well as renewable energy which brings me to my final point:\n\n(Side note: I wouldn't expect emergency services such as ambulances or fire trucks or people who use a vehicle for work such as builders or delivery people to foot this increased bill as much or at all in cases like ambulances)\n\nIncreased production of electric vehicles. This means my public transport plan would only be in effect while electric vehicles were massed produced. This means people who work in car factories wouldn't lose their jobs or mechanics.\n\nNow this would require tonnes of planning and money but who thinks this could work? I'd be interested to know!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/7u40wm/buses_instead_of_cars/

The plastic bags used today are, ironically, not very green. I have been looking for something that could preferably be resealed, but it is not a necessity. It should also be somewhat air tight, but I feel that would be pretty difficult with paper. I needs to be easily biodegradable. PLA is not ideal, with it still taking a long time to degrade in a landfill, but its better than petroleum based polymers.\n\nBasically, what I am asking is if there are any products that meet my criteria, or any materials that would fit the criteria that I could make into small bags my self.\n\nThanks in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/7tbo90/ideas_for_small_zip_lock_plastic_bag_alternatives/

Sounds crazy at the first moment, but it looks actually like a great solution. I looked into it and I myself find it revolutionary. They are called “Gaias Homes”\n\nTheir system is similar to Lego - A one Family house could be build in only 5 days and costs so little that everyone can buy one ( THIS WAS A WOW EFFECT FOR ME ) And it cleans up the environment from all that nasty plastic.\n\nI personally LOVE that Idea and think that concepts like this are ( or at least should be) the future of Construction and Real Estate\n\nAs far as I know, their technology is still open source and they just start business - I can smell great opportunities for Entrepreneurs here!\n\nHere is the Link to an article about them on their own Eco -News Platform; for everyone interested into it:\n\nhttps://gaiashomes.com/building-homes-recycled-plastic/\n\nWhat do you guys think about that?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/7jz4rx/startup_in_india_builds_affordable_homes_out_of/

There are several services that are designed in a way that creates revenue; the money is then donated to charities across the world. I'll go through some of the resouces I've found, but write a comment if you know any similar services. The services are listed in their order of impact.\n\n[Ecosia](https://info.ecosia.org/what): Ecosia is a search engine built off of Bing and other existing services. The search engine will then display ads at the top of the search, like Google and Bing already do, and the money gained from clicking these ads goes to several reforestry projects across the world. Generally whenever I see the ads, I'll open them in a new tab and then quickly close them when I found the website I'm actually looking for. In [August 2017](http://documents.ecosia.org/369415/12019080), they raised almost $400,000 for tree projects around the world!\n\n[Tab For a Cause](http://tab.gladly.io/): This service changes your tabbing experience so that when you open a new tab, two ads are placed in the bottom right half of your screen. Every tab generates hearts, which then allows you to decide where the ad revenue goes. You are also able to made additions to the page, create bookmarks tiles, and add widgets to the new tab page. \n\n[Smile Always](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smile-always/jgpmhnmjbhgkhpbgelalfpplebgfjmbf): Smile Always is a cool program that automatically transfers you to smile.amazon which donates 1% of goods purchased to a charity.

77twd8,1508598611,Critical Ecology,"Critical Ecology is my proposed response to our current broken political economy and it's underlying ideologies, which I believe are the fundamental sources of environmental degradation and unsustainability.\n\nMy goal is just to spread ideas so people can consider alternatives wherever they are. Thoughts and critiques are welcome and encouraged.\n\nCritical Ecology would simultaneously be an intellectual critique, an integrated worldview, a social movement, a personal practice, and an embodied lifestyle, with its basic value being the flourishing of all humans, all life, and all the Earth.\n\nIts fundamental ideas would derive from the synthesis of work done by scholars of sociology and geography; would incorporate knowledge from the fields of economics, anthropology, ecology, environment studies, and beyond; and would draw inspiration from various non-violent and/or revolutionary movements.\n\nAs an intellectual critique, it would mainly draw from sociology and geography in demonstrating the social and environmental destructiveness of neoliberalism as well as critically examining the processes that perpetuate its structure/ideology.\n\nAs an integrated worldview, it would draw from Deep Ecology and recognize the fundamental inter- and intra- relatedness of every human to every thing.\n\nAs a social movement, it would be founded on the principles of prefigurative politics, as well as accepting anyone who might only be interested in participating in a particular facet of Critical Ecology.\nAs a personal practice, it would involve remaining conscious as possible about one's day-to-day choices and their impacts.\n\nAnd as an embodied lifestyle, it would begin with forming communities to discuss issues relating to Critical Ecology as well as networking people in order to generate local solutions, in time this would lead to living out alternatives to the status quo.\n\nPlease don't take my post too seriously, like I said, my goal is to propose a response in order to start a discussion about organizing and systematically challenging the forces that are destroying our planet, not to lay out my solution.\n\nedit: changed some wordings, added some details",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/77twd8/critical_ecology/

6jcbs1,1498361680,Green Party USA collective audience on social media reaches 6.7 million people!,"Link to the Tally Sheet &gt;&gt;&gt; https://mk-amed47.tumblr.com/post/161380145231/green-party-usa-collective-audience \n\nI've been scanning through the chatter on progressive media for the past few months and was sick and tired of Justice Democrats dominating the narrative on Reddit and Peoples Party dominating the narrative on Twitter. While the Green Party has certainly found a hub on Facebook I was really starting to wonder who exactly is the biggest faction of progressives besides the lefty independents. \n\nTo my surprise the Greens come out as one of the largest factions with 6.7 million people altogether if you combine the social media profiles of the GNC (Green National Committee), Official Green Fist organizations and outlets, Green Fist allies and figureheads. Right now if we keep up the good work of informing other progressives and American voters about Green politics we'll be well on our way to guaranteeing at least 5% of the vote in national elections. \n\nThe goal I would like to see reached is to make it to 42 million collective audience across social media platforms. Why is this number special? It's because 42 million is roughly 15% of the electorate and it will all but give us a much greater chance of getting into presidential debates. Never mind the amount of cross over votes we would have access to. \n\nRegardless I would like to see the Green Party register no less than 5 million people by 2020 so we can get through ballot access and have a strong shot of reaching the 5% mark in the presidential elections. The good news is that the Green Party is mainstream now at least online. Now it's up to us to start acting like it and demand equal coverage in major progressive media (Democracy Now!, The Young Turks, The Ring of Fire). So far Counter Propa, Real Progressives USA, and Progressive Army are among the few progressive outlets that will give equal coverage of the Green Party's political activity and growth. It takes an audience of 1 million to be considered mainstream online. We are currently at 6.7 million by my estimates if you put all the social media profiles together. Mind you I am not saying all these followers online will always equal voters. What it does show is that there is most certainly a growing interest in Green politics that now I have some hard data to show is the case!\n\nThe benefit of reaching mainstream status is now we don't spam the trending engines or our friends/followers on our profiles to get their attention. Now we can focus on building rapport and cross communication. Informing people more thoroughly about the issues and interests of the Green Party. This way we can set the record straight regarding propaganda and misconceptions lobbied against the Greens and the progressive agenda. Not only with other leftists but those who are on the center and the right as well. Feel free to check out my Tally on the Green Party's current standing on the people's media!

Long hair would demand X amount of shampoo in a year or a lifetime and longer shower times to wash. Keeping a shaved head would require razors and soap for scalp. In the entire rest of the lives of my 2 kids and I alone, the potential waste here could add up, and while it may not be a significant harm it's still good to go the xtra mile out of principle. I weigh the two in my mind like a teeter totter. These are of course two extremes. Is a happy medium of short hair best? Any opinions would be appreciated and help us decide if we need to go to the barber soon.\n\nEdit: my kids and I all 3 don't like going to the barber so while I do want to know the best scientifically speculated answers and will aspire to live accordingly, we've got our fingers crossed for ditching the scissors.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/6c54iz/splittng_hairs/

5zehnp,1489521380,Diamond based electronics for green energy (xpost r/RenewableEnergy r/Green r/Electronics),"GreenDiamond is a €4 million European Horizon 2020 project launched in June 2015 to develop breakthrough 10 kV diamond transistor technology for sustainable high power electronics. Diamond’s exceptional electronic and thermal properties make it the ultimate semiconductor for efficient transmission and conversion of electrical energy and could play a vital role in our future low-carbon society. As the project reaches its midpoint, the team from UCL’s Diamond Electronics Group have produced a video introducing the goals of the GreenDiamond project and its consortium of 15 academic, research and industrial partners from 6 different countries.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbpohTjthjE\n\nThe GreenDiamond project aims to produce high power transistors that will increase the efficiency of electricity production, distribution and adaptability to future smart grids with delocalized renewable energy sources. In Spain alone it is estimated that 9% of electrical energy is wasted in grid losses (source: International Energy Association). This is likely to increase with time due to the material limits of available technologies. Diamond however has a dielectric breakdown strength 3 times higher than that of silicon carbide and more than 30 times better than that of silicon, the carrier mobility is very high for both carrier types and the thermal conductivity is unsurpassed, making it the ideal candidate for such applications and offering the possibility of a step change in performance.\n “GreenDiamond brings together the best labs in Europe and industry to make this step change in technology happen and enhance European leadership in the field. It is an exciting time for diamond and power electronics.” says Etienne Gheeraert from Institut Néel. Gheeraert is leading the consortium composed of groups from the CNRS Institut Néel and G2ELab, CEA and ESRF (France), UCL and University of Cambridge (UK), IMEC (Belgium), Fraunhofer IAF (Germany), University of Cadiz, Tecnalia and CSIC-CNM (Spain). Industrial partners include Camutronics (UK), Ion Beam Services (France) and Win Inertia (Spain) as a potential end user. Wavestone (Luxembourg), in collaboration with Institut Néel, are responsible for the management of the project.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/5zehnp/diamond_based_electronics_for_green_energy_xpost/

5z8ryf,1489449595,Will a clean energy revolution actually create jobs?,"Progressives commonly argue that a green revolution will create jobs. I don't really understand how this plays out. The thing with oil, natural gas, and coal is that they're constantly being extracted, and the site of extraction moves around as areas are depleted. That in addition to the constant need to process and ship fuel makes it so at least some amount of low level human skill is needed and supplied. But with something like solar panels or wind turbines, once the initial assembly and installation is accomplished, how many jobs are actually needed?? Doesn't this infrastructure last sometimes up to 30 years? And what are these jobs? Engineers? Wouldn't a complete green energy revolution provide some original work, but eventually result in a large portion of low-moderate skill level workers unemployed? I mean the fossil fuel industry is huge! If I'm missing something here please post links &amp; comments to help me make sense of this. And if I'm not missing something, how will we compensate these workers in our current capitalist framework that we have to work with? Especially in the United States, most people can't afford to just go get higher education and raise their skill level or social class.\n\nThanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/5z8ryf/will_a_clean_energy_revolution_actually_create/

5oh313,1484644139,Ecosia - The greener Google.,"One of my friends shared Escosia's facebook page and after some investigating I've made the switch from Google to Ecosia as my default searcher.\n\nBasically they use the money generated from advertised result links to fund tree planting projects. Even if you use ad blocker it still helps them out as the more users they have, the more they can charge advertisers (and therefore have more money to fund the projects).\n\nFor some things it's not so great like quick definitions or store opening times, but on the whole it's doing a great thing. I've had it for a few days and already 'planted' 75 trees. Perhaps in time they will improve the service. In my opinion its still so worth it for the good they are doing. Their goal is to plant 1 Billion trees by 2020 and they actually plant trees that are native and sustainable.\n\nI recommend you at least give it a try.\n\nwww.ecosia.org\n\nfor more info: info.ecosia.org/what",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/5oh313/ecosia_the_greener_google/

Do y'all have suggestions for this? Thin cotton bags maybe? \n\n2) Start composting. Also unsure about how to go about it, but my apartment building recently got one of the composting bins outside, so now I have no excuse not to.\n\n3) Make my own meat subs/seitan instead of buying pre-packaged versions.

5fmx2v,1480471586,Coalition of US states creating common environmental regulations,"Although many people have expressed concern about the Trump administration's stance on environmental issues, I haven't seen any solid approaches (yet, and I'd be happy to be introduced to them) to realistically counter the threat. This isn't just about the Paris Agreement, but the possibility of the EPA watering down clean-air regs, etc, etc. So, in the face of lower regulatory standards at a federal level, is there anything that can be practicably be done to drive environment concerns forward?\n\nThe best idea I have, and I'd like to open it up to discussion (OK, full on criticism) is this:\n\nThe California Environmental Protection Agency had reasonable success in pushing for improved environmental controls for its residents that have led industry to adapt across the country to avoid a huge loss in potential customers. At times the federal EPA had chosen to, or been forced to catch up. \n\nHow about reinforcing this concept of large populations driving change by forming a coalition of like-minded states for environmental policy? I understand already that governors discuss common issues occasionally and large city mayors get together at times. How about a more formal collaboration? \n\nImagine the potential of California, New York, Oregon, Washington and Massachusetts acting as a unified force. Imagine how much could be achieved if the combined populations of these states were united through a single, meaningful environmental policy and regulation, consistent across the coalition. Federal regulators could water down their responsibilities as much as the executive demanded of them. A coalition of states could represent their citizens better than DC, while reducing the cost of writing new legislation (they reuse a single template), and leveraging consumer power to push industry (and potentially other states) to clean up their act. \n\nQuestions: is their any precedent for groups of states collaborating to this level of formality; is there any constitutional or legal reason this would not work; would residents of these states buy into such as plan?\n\nBig, stupid idea.

5d68uc,1479256875,"The DEA is trying to ban another plant, this time Kratom (Call To Action)","This time it's kratom (Mitragyna speciosa), a plant from Southeast Asia related to the coffee plant. People have used it for thousands, if not tens of thousands of years for physical pain, fever reduction, diarrhea, coughs, hypertension, anxiety, depression, insomnia, fatigue, and PTSD among other things. Countless people have used it to help break their opiate or alcohol addiction. Kratom has saved many lives in this way. \n\nIn lower doses it's stimulating like caffeine and in higher doses it's sedating. Most people take it in their morning tea. Though some take it in capsule form because it is so bitter. You do not become inebriated from kratom and it is not an opiate. It does not cause respiratory depression and is not a hallucinogenic. It is about as habit forming as coffee. The primary alkaloid in kratom, mitragynine, is also present in the coffee plant. Kratom's effects are mild at most. Millions of Americans (estimated 3-5 million by the AKA) are using kratom today and have been for decades. There are thousands of (possibly more than 10,000 estimated by the BEA) hard working American kratom small businesses.\n\nThe DEA tried to emergency schedule (ban) kratom in September. They cited as their reason 15 deaths over a two year timespan. They later admitted that those deaths involved other substances, which were undoubtedly the cause. Compare this to the literal millions of poisonings and deaths caused by things like prescription drugs, alcohol, tobacco, Tylenol, Aspirin, caffeine, food allergies, laundry detergent pods, etc. every year. This is actually a record of amazing safety. If kratom was actually dangerous as the DEA is portraying then there would be millions of dead people. They were actually going to put kratom into Schedule I with heroin which is beyond absurd and frankly insane. \n\nAfter the large public backlash the DEA temporarily retracted the ban. This has never happened before in the entire history of the DEA. It is historic. They are now doing a public commenting period on the Regulations.gov website (on track for the most comments ever) until December 1st while the FDA does an 8 factor analysis on kratom.\n\nAs an example of how kratom is treated in other places, in Canada, kratom is completely legal and classified as a NHP or Natural Health Product under Schedule 1 item 1 (plant or plant material) of the NHP Regulations. In 2015 the Florida Department of Law Enforcement studied kratom and determined that ""Kratom does not constitute a significant risk to the safety and welfare of Florida residents."" The Florida Department of Health added that, ""there are no pervasive health issues that can be attributed to the ingestion of kratom products in Florida."" \n\nIf you would like to do something about this issue then you can sign the Whitehouse.gov [petition](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/please-do-not-make-kratom-schedule-i-substance)(complete) and Action Network [petition](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/do-not-place-kratom-on-the-schedule-substance-list?source=gplus). The [American Kratom Association](http://www.americankratom.org/) and the [Botanical Education Alliance](https://www.botanical-education.org/) are raising funds to stop the ban. You may also contact your [Senators](http://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/) and ask them to sign Senator Orrin Hatch's [letter](http://216.30.191.148/SenateKratomLetterFinal.pdf) to the DEA which has 9 signatures or Senator Ron Wyden's [letter](http://216.30.191.148/9.29.16LettertoDEAonKratomEmergencySchedulingFinalSigne1.pdf) which has 3 signatures. You may also contact your [Representative](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/) and ask them to sign Representative Mark Pocan's/Matt Salmon's [letter](https://www.botanical-education.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DEAKratomLetter9.26.2016.pdf) to the DEA which has 51 signatures. You can also contact the White House directly [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact). There is also a kratom [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/).\n\nIf you have personal experience (not required) with kratom then I highly suggest you [leave a comment](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DEA-2016-0015-0006) to the DEA on the Regulations.gov website or alternatively [here](http://kratomcomments.org/#/5/).\n\n\n\nIt would be very helpful if the mods could sticky this thread while the situation is developing. The community must stand united on issues like this. We can't allow millions more Americans who have done nothing wrong and hurt no one to be turned into criminals and become victims of the Drug War for using a natural herbal health supplement.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/5d68uc/the_dea_is_trying_to_ban_another_plant_this_time/

(Don't use the first round of soapy water, use the last round instead, they are cleaner and clearer).\n* Avoid taking lift/elevator. Take escalator or stairs instead.\n* When boiling food, turn off gas 10 seconds earlier. The heat left in the stove and the cooking ware is enough to replace at least 10 seconds of heat. Sometimes when cooking instant noodle, I turn off the heat 30 seconds earlier and then take it odd from the stove.\n* When cooking, cut food into smaller pieces, they get cooked faster and therefore use less heat.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/5aomz0/lets_share_some_green_living_tips_here/

Arguing that Hillary is a nightmare is very reasonable but Hillary is a ""I was back in high school and was naked and my crush saw me and laughed"" type nightmare while Trump is a ""Evil clowns with poisoned machetes chased me for several hours and I ended up falling off a skyscraper into a pit of rabid hyenas"" type nightmare.

Electric Motorcycle vs. Electric Car vs. Gas Car?,"I live in LA, CA where things such as electric cars, charging stations, etc. tend to be very progressive and I want to make the jump to electric. Especially after going on a recent road trip with a buddy of mine in his EV (Kia Soul) and noticing how it wasn't really that much of a change (very similar to charging a smartphone nightly), it seems like owning an EV should be a no-brainer.\n\nI'm lucky enough to miss the majority of traffic, as I live four minutes away from work, and pretty much every store and outlet I need is in close proximity. I feel bad owning a gas-powered car since I'm near everything I need. It just seems wasteful. \nI've considered bicycles, but I'd prefer to be in the car lane for safety (there are some major roads near me which are tough for bicycles) and would like the occasional road trip that an electric motorcycle could offer.\n\n\nSome questions:\n\n• I understand that I'll need an M1 license, but what are some pieces of insight to riding a motorcycle in sometimes potentially heavy traffic areas in LA?\n\n• Electric Motorcyles can range in price from around $7k-$16k, before the accessories/gear. From the sound of it, the reduced cost of insurance, maintenance, cost of ownership (compared to electric cars), and fuel, along with the added benefits of federal and possible state (I believe CA is on a waiting list now), will possibly make it a smart investment. Buying vs. leasing is a whole other topic.\n\nThe company Zero looks really appealing for electric motorcycles and last year they knocked off $1,350 on all models due to rising competition. \nAdditionally, they have $1000 cash back for their 10th anniversary this month, so I'm really debating it\n\n\nAny real world experience on this would be appreciated.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/4suejr/help_electric_motorcycle_vs_electric_car_vs_gas/

The, at least to me, irrational level of groupthink surrounding transgenics, i.e. genetic engineering of foodcrops. I can certainly understand being untrustworthy of large corporations, but the science is sound. This may be going away, but in the past, it has severely turned me away and made me wonder about their other views on science.\n\n2. The complete and total opposition to nuclear power. For a movement born out of the ideals of ecological sustainability, nuclear power should be a top priority. I can understand opposition to older model reactors, but the new Gen III+ models are a different deal entirely. This technology has the ability to shut down literally every coal fired power plant around the world when coupled with heavy use of solar, wind, and other alternatives. On a secondary note, what about the potential of fusion power?\n\nApart from these two things, I think I was turned off by the party years ago by rhetoric that was frankly of the Neo-Malthusian or Neo-Luddite nature. Not to mention the close proximity to multiple things of the ""woo"" and pseudoscientific variety. I really do want to like the party, and will probably vote for Stein regardless, but these are serious concerns I have for continued support into the future.\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/4p13i8/potential_yet_apprehensive_new_voter/

My father was the one who noticed it and was able to get me to come in and recast my vote for the Green Party candidate on the correct ballot.  The reason we were handed the wrong ballot is because the Nonpartisan ballot was printed with a green background, and the Green ballot had a red background.  Who does that?  It is so obvious that the green background goes with the Green party ballot and nonpartisan should not have a background color at all.

4lx02j,1464722617,The Green Party's #1 priority should be to spoil elections and demand Instant Runoff Voting (Alternative Vote),"The biggest obstacle any 3rd parties face is simply being considered a viable option.  The current [plurality/First Past The Post](https://youtu.be/s7tWHJfhiyo) system makes winning an election by any third party an uphill battle at easiest and impossible in most cases.  The Green Party's #1 priority should be to use the little power it has as a spoiler to pressure Democrats to champion [Instant Runoff Voting/Alternative Vote](https://youtu.be/3Y3jE3B8HsE).  No other Green causes can move forward without making it possible to win elections first.  [IRV is on the Green Party platform](http://www.gp.org/democracy#DemPoliticalReform) but I see it discussed so little.\n\nWhen David Cobb ran for President on the Green ticket in 2004 he chose a [""Smart States""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cobb_presidential_campaign,_2004) strategy which emphasized states that were secure Democrat/Republican states and ignoring battleground states.  The reason for this strategy was because the Democrats cried foul after Nader spoiled the election for Gore, causing Bush to win the election.  Cobb's strategy was flawed however, because it essentially just gave the Democrats what they wanted, no competition from Greens.  Cobb had the initiative and could have pressed the matter further but essentially backed down in 2004.  We got nothing for it and Bush was still elected.  Now look at our present situation.  Is Hillary vs Trump any improvement from Bush vs Kerry?  Don't expect it to get any better in the future by voting for the lesser of two evils.\n\nThe only influence Greens have in this system is the spoiler effect.  And to not use it is the same as not running a campaign at all.  If Greens had kept the momentum from 2000 going with the same strategy in 2004, Democrats would have realized that their whining didn't work and they would have to start negotiating.  But their whining did work, because we let it.\n\nI've noticed that IRV is mysteriously absent from the [Libertarian platform](https://www.lp.org/platform), but I see no reason why it should be.  Libertarians can be affecting the Republicans in the same way.  Greens should reach out to Libertarians and develop a joint strategy emphasizing the spoiling of different races.\n\nNo other issue on either party's platform can make headway until we get elected first.  And to get elected we need IRV.  To get IRV we need to spoil elections.\n\nThis is what I suggest in a nutshell:\n\n* Green Federal level campaigns(Congress, Senate, President), should not be focused on winning, but on spoiling(unless polls actually show that the Green has a chance of winning).  Campaigning should be the hardest in battleground areas.\n* When Democrats complain, double down and pledge to continue doing the same in every future election.  Don't negotiate as they can always back down from a promise.  The power is in the hands of the Democrats, they are able to fix this if they wish to.\n* Create a partnership with Libertarians to do the same thing to Republicans, choosing together which contests to specifically focus on.\n* Instant Runoff Voting will now become a higher priority for the Democrats and the Republicans as they realize the only way to stop the spoiling is to eliminate the spoiler effect.\n* Once Instant Runoff Voting is implemented, we can now compete normally in elections and stand a chance of pursuing the other causes in our platform.\n\nAs a sidenote the only other candidate that has IRV in their platform is [Bernie Sanders](http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-political-and-electoral-reform/#the-two-party-system).  He is the only other candidate I'm considering voting for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/4lx02j/the_green_partys_1_priority_should_be_to_spoil/

4gam94,1461540367,My Plant A Tree Project,I’m a senior in highschool and we have a project that ask us to help the world or community in any way. For my project I wanted it to be about global warming and let people know the consequences of it. One of the main problems is that our atmosphere is getting filled with more carbon each year. This causes a greenhouse effect which heats up our atmosphere because the carbon helps retain heat. What I want to do is have people buy a tree or any plant and know that that plant is taking carbon out of the atmosphere. I know that this won’t help take out all of the carbon in the atmosphere but I want this to serve as awareness and letting people know that global warming is serious and threatening all life on our planet.\n\n**[Link to my google survey](http://goo.gl/forms/tcr03nNPAm)** where you can find a couple websites where you can buy plants. If you know any more I’d like to add them here. This survey is what I really need done for my project.\n\n[Link to a commercial I made](https://www.wevideo.com/view/626528614) that sheds \nsome light on my issue and what I want to do.  \n\n[Link to a poster I made](https://imgur.com/jBRpye9) that you can share if you’d like to.\n\nHere’s 35 facts about global warming I had to find for my project. [Source](http://www.conserve-energy-future.com/various-global-warming-facts.php)\n\nIf you have any feedback I’d like to hear it.

That said, I do understand why farms would want to get the most money out of their land as possible.  \n  \nMy idea is this -  \n  \n* Determine an ideal baseline water usage for agriculture.  \n* Tax farms in an amount relative to how much they exceed the baseline.  \n* Use the revenue generated to pay farmers that grow crops that fall below the baseline. Again, payment would be relative to the baseline.

4eksfs,1460539393,I’m trying to create a business that helps the environment… I’d love to know what you think?,"Hey guys. I’ve been trying to find out (as you may have noticed from my previous post in this thread) what people do every day to help the environment. The reason for this is because I’m have the oppertunity to create a business that helps the environment in some way, so identifying what people find easiest to do every day is really helping me with my research.\n\nSo far I’ve had one idea which I think would work, but I’m really interested to hear what everyone in this thread thinks. Everyone seems super engaged on here, so although I’m a bit nervous about getting bad feedback, I think any thoughts will be really helpful at this stage.\n\nThe first idea came when I realised how much stuff I had that I didn’t want, use or need. A friend came over to my house to help me clear out my garage and he saw a power drill I haven’t used in years. He asked if he could have it. I agreed, and he offered to swap it for a large picture frame I’d often admired that he hadn’t found any art to put in.\n\nThis got me thinking… how many people have things like this that they could swap for things they actually did want or need? It would save people throwing things away and avoid the need to buy new things that may or may not be made at a cost to the environment (not even including packaging etc).\n\nAlso the idea of trading instead of buying appealed to the part of me that longs for a more community friendly way of acquiring things.\n\nAnyway, at the moment this is in development so I would really, really appreciate it if you could tell me what you think - even if you think it’s a pretty bad idea!\n\nIf you would like me to send you the link to the site I am building, please let me know. I didn't just want to drop it in here in case you're not really allowed to do that? I'm not sure",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/4eksfs/im_trying_to_create_a_business_that_helps_the/

4cudn9,1459493228,How should sustainable development be promoted in developing countries.,"According to the world bank, sustainable development means\n&gt;""Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.""\n\nShifting to sustainable development is a huge leap to jump for developing countries. Mainly in my opinion due to these problems.\n\nCorruption is prevalent in developing countries. Lots of officials take bribes.  Because of this it is difficult to properly implement regulations regarding the environmental impact and human rights. Politicians and officials would often do things that are detrimental to the country in hopes of personal gain. \n\nLack of awareness and interest in sustainable development among majority of the public. In developing countries, a majority of the population lack a standard education. Because of this they don't understand the significance of it. Farmers would use large quantities of harmful pesticides on crops to increase yield. But they would not understand how doing so becomes detrimental to the health of not only the consumers of the crops but even themselves who grow it. Same goes for workers in other industries.\nLack of interest is also another factor. Lot of people in this part of world suffers from poverty. When your chief concern becomes trying to bring food to the table, there is no time to care about the effect on the environment. For example, even if the farmers knew about growing organic crops or using less pesticides, they wouldn't do so because it will reduce their intimidate income. \n\nMultinational corporations outsourcing production plants to developing countries. This itself is not a problem. In fact it is beneficial for developing societies. These corporations create lots of jobs in areas with high unemployment. Problems arise when these corporations pollute the environment in the host countries and sometimes violate human and labor rights of it's workers. This happens again because of corruption and failure to implement regulation in these countries.\n\nTransitioning from the manufacturing and production methods practiced currently to more sustainable methods is expensive. Developing countries don't have the money to consider these. Governments are having a hard time combating disease prevention, poverty and food shortages. Caring about sustainability is a luxury.\n\nAs explained above these are my personal opinions of why it is difficult to promote sustainable development in developing countries, so there might be errors and others factors I didn't consider. I wrote this partially from my personal experience as a citizen of a developing country.\n\nMy question is how to overcome these problems and any other problems I didn't mention in the road towards sustainable development. Lack of it is having a detrimental effect on the health of the citizens of many developing countries. And China having surpassed USA in the total greenhouse gas emissions, it is no longer possible for the developed world to ignore this problem. What is happening in the developing world will not only impact their own countries but the whole world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/4cudn9/how_should_sustainable_development_be_promoted_in/
