# Master-Thesis

There is an increased sense that a large set of companies introduce
sustainability concepts through written and spoken language to
show their real performance or (mis)guide the stakeholders as well
as to legitimize their presence. From a business perspective, the
annual reports of companies are investigated many times but also
the conference calls can be taken as another resource. From society
perspective, there is a growing awareness regarding universal
problems such as sustainability concerns through social media such
as Reddit, Twitter, and TED Talks. Especially, during COVID, a
common threat plaguing the whole world, the question remains
unanswered whether the business world considers more about the
demands of society regarding sustainability issues. In this respect,
this paper applies a variety of text mining techniques such as lexical
analysis, topic modeling, sentiment analysis and named entity
recognition to assess whether the firms’ linguistic reactions’ to
society’s demands have changed in the sustainability context in the
comparison of before and after COVID.

To what extent can NLP discover the evolution of the topics in
business domain in response to societal backlash through social
media in the context of sustainability before and after COVID?
